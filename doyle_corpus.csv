"11",2344,"In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental"
"12",2344,"qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have endeavoured, as far as"
"13",2344,"possible, to select those which presented the minimum of"
"14",2344,"sensationalism, while offering a fair field for his talents.  It is,"
"15",2344,"however, unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational"
"16",2344,"from the criminal, and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must"
"17",2344,"either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so"
"18",2344,"give a false impression of the problem, or he must use matter which"
"19",2344,"chance, and not choice, has provided him with.  With this short preface"
"20",2344,"I shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a"
"21",2344,"peculiarly terrible, chain of events."
"22",2344,""
"23",2344,"It was a blazing hot day in August.  Baker Street was like an oven, and"
"24",2344,"the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across"
"25",2344,"the road was painful to the eye.  It was hard to believe that these"
"26",2344,"were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of"
"27",2344,"winter.  Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the"
"28",2344,"sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the"
"29",2344,"morning post.  For myself, my term of service in India had trained me"
"30",2344,"to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no"
"31",2344,"hardship.  But the morning paper was uninteresting.  Parliament had"
"32",2344,"risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the"
"33",2344,"New Forest or the shingle of Southsea.  A depleted bank account had"
"34",2344,"caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the"
"35",2344,"country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him.  He"
"36",2344,"loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people, with his"
"37",2344,"filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every"
"38",2344,"little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime.  Appreciation of nature"
"39",2344,"found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he"
"40",2344,"turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his"
"41",2344,"brother of the country."
"42",2344,""
"43",2344,"Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed aside"
"44",2344,"the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a brown"
"45",2344,"study.  Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts:"
"46",2344,""
"47",2344,"""You are right, Watson,"" said he.  ""It does seem a most preposterous"
"48",2344,"way of settling a dispute."""
"49",2344,""
"50",2344,"""Most preposterous!"" I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he"
"51",2344,"had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and"
"52",2344,"stared at him in blank amazement."
"53",2344,""
"54",2344,"""What is this, Holmes?"" I cried.  ""This is beyond anything which I"
"55",2344,"could have imagined."""
"56",2344,""
"57",2344,"He laughed heartily at my perplexity."
"58",2344,""
"59",2344,"""You remember,"" said he, ""that some little time ago when I read you the"
"60",2344,"passage in one of Poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the"
"61",2344,"unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were inclined to treat the"
"62",2344,"matter as a mere tour-de-force of the author.  On my remarking that I"
"63",2344,"was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed"
"64",2344,"incredulity."""
"65",2344,""
"66",2344,"""Oh, no!"""
"67",2344,""
"68",2344,"""Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with your"
"69",2344,"eyebrows.  So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a"
"70",2344,"train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity of reading"
"71",2344,"it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof that I had been"
"72",2344,"in rapport with you."""
"73",2344,""
"74",2344,"But I was still far from satisfied.  ""In the example which you read to"
"75",2344,"me,"" said I, ""the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the"
"76",2344,"man whom he observed. If I remember right, he stumbled over a heap of"
"77",2344,"stones, looked up at the stars, and so on.  But I have been seated"
"78",2344,"quietly in my chair, and what clues can I have given you?"""
"79",2344,""
"80",2344,"""You do yourself an injustice.  The features are given to man as the"

"84",2344,"""Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my"

"86",2344,""
"87",2344,"""Your features and especially your eyes.  Perhaps you cannot yourself"
"88",2344,"recall how your reverie commenced?"""
"89",2344,""
"90",2344,"""No, I cannot."""
"91",2344,""
"92",2344,"""Then I will tell you.  After throwing down your paper, which was the"
"93",2344,"action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a"
"94",2344,"vacant expression.  Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly"
"95",2344,"framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your"
"96",2344,"face that a train of thought had been started.  But it did not lead"
"97",2344,"very far.  Your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of Henry"
"98",2344,"Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books.  Then you glanced"
"99",2344,"up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious.  You were"
"100",2344,"thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare"
"101",2344,"space and correspond with Gordon's picture there."""
"102",2344,""
"103",2344,"""You have followed me wonderfully!"" I exclaimed."
"104",2344,""
"105",2344,"""So far I could hardly have gone astray.  But now your thoughts went"
"106",2344,"back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the"
"107",2344,"character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you"
"108",2344,"continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful.  You were"
"109",2344,"recalling the incidents of Beecher's career.  I was well aware that you"
"110",2344,"could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on"
"111",2344,"behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember your"
"112",2344,"expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was"
"113",2344,"received by the more turbulent of our people.  You felt so strongly"
"114",2344,"about it that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of"
"115",2344,"that also.  When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the"
"116",2344,"picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War,"
"117",2344,"and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your"
"118",2344,"hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the"
"119",2344,"gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But"
"120",2344,"then, again, your face grew sadder, you shook your head.  You were"
"121",2344,"dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life.  Your"
"122",2344,"hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your"
"123",2344,"lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of"
"124",2344,"settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At"
"125",2344,"this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to"
"126",2344,"find that all my deductions had been correct."""
"127",2344,""
"128",2344,"""Absolutely!"" said I.  ""And now that you have explained it, I confess"
"129",2344,"that I am as amazed as before."""
"130",2344,""
"131",2344,"""It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you.  I should not"
"132",2344,"have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity"
"133",2344,"the other day.  But I have in my hands here a little problem which may"
"134",2344,"prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought"
"135",2344,"reading.  Have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to"
"136",2344,"the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to Miss"
"137",2344,"Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?"""
"138",2344,""
"139",2344,"""No, I saw nothing."""
"140",2344,""
"141",2344,"""Ah! then you must have overlooked it.  Just toss it over to me. Here"
"142",2344,"it is, under the financial column.  Perhaps you would be good enough to"
"143",2344,"read it aloud."""
"144",2344,""
"145",2344,"I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the"
"146",2344,"paragraph indicated. It was headed, ""A Gruesome Packet."""
"147",2344,""
"148",2344,"""Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been made the"
"149",2344,"victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical"
"150",2344,"joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to"
"151",2344,"the incident.  At two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet,"
"152",2344,"wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman.  A cardboard box"
"153",2344,"was inside, which was filled with coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss"
"154",2344,"Cushing was horrified to find two human ears, apparently quite freshly"
"155",2344,"severed.  The box had been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the"
"156",2344,"morning before.  There is no indication as to the sender, and the"
"157",2344,"matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of"
"158",2344,"fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or"
"159",2344,"correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything"
"160",2344,"through the post.  Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge,"
"161",2344,"she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom"
"162",2344,"she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular"
"163",2344,"habits.  The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been"
"164",2344,"perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge"
"165",2344,"and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the"
"166",2344,"dissecting-rooms.  Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact"
"167",2344,"that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the"
"168",2344,"best of Miss Cushing's belief, from Belfast.  In the meantime, the"
"169",2344,"matter is being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very"
"170",2344,"smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case."""
"171",2344,""
"172",2344,"""So much for the Daily Chronicle,"" said Holmes as I finished reading."
"173",2344,"""Now for our friend Lestrade.  I had a note from him this morning, in"
"174",2344,"which he says:"
"175",2344,""
"176",2344,"""I think that this case is very much in your line.  We have every hope"
"177",2344,"of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting"
"178",2344,"anything to work upon.  We have, of course, wired to the Belfast"
"179",2344,"post-office, but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that"
"180",2344,"day, and they have no means of identifying this particular one, or of"
"181",2344,"remembering the sender.  The box is a half-pound box of honeydew"
"182",2344,"tobacco and does not help us in any way.  The medical student theory"
"183",2344,"still appears to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a"
"184",2344,"few hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here.  I shall"
"185",2344,"be either at the house or in the police-station all day."
"186",2344,""
"187",2344,"""What say you, Watson?  Can you rise superior to the heat and run down"
"188",2344,"to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?"""
"189",2344,""
"190",2344,"""I was longing for something to do."""
"191",2344,""
"192",2344,"""You shall have it then.  Ring for our boots and tell them to order a"

"195",2344,""
"196",2344,"A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was far"
"197",2344,"less oppressive in Croydon than in town.  Holmes had sent on a wire, so"
"198",2344,"that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as ever, was"
"199",2344,"waiting for us at the station.  A walk of five minutes took us to Cross"
"200",2344,"Street, where Miss Cushing resided."
"201",2344,""
"202",2344,"It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim,"
"203",2344,"with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping"
"204",2344,"at the doors.  Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and tapped at a door,"
"205",2344,"which was opened by a small servant girl.  Miss Cushing was sitting in"
"206",2344,"the front room, into which we were ushered.  She was a placid-faced"
"207",2344,"woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair curving down over her"
"208",2344,"temples on each side.  A worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a"
"209",2344,"basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her."
"210",2344,""
"211",2344,"""They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,"" said she as Lestrade"
"212",2344,"entered.  ""I wish that you would take them away altogether."""
"213",2344,""
"214",2344,"""So I shall, Miss Cushing.  I only kept them here until my friend, Mr."
"215",2344,"Holmes, should have seen them in your presence."""
"216",2344,""
"217",2344,"""Why in my presence, sir?"""
"218",2344,""
"219",2344,"""In case he wished to ask any questions."""

"222",2344,"whatever about it?"""
"223",2344,""
"224",2344,"""Quite so, madam,"" said Holmes in his soothing way.  ""I have no doubt"
"225",2344,"that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business."""
"226",2344,""
"227",2344,"""Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It is"
"228",2344,"something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the"
"229",2344,"police in my house.  I won't have those things in here, Mr. Lestrade."
"230",2344,"If you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse."""
"231",2344,""
"232",2344,"It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house."
"233",2344,"Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box, with a piece"
"234",2344,"of brown paper and some string.  There was a bench at the end of the"
"235",2344,"path, and we all sat down while Homes examined one by one, the articles"
"236",2344,"which Lestrade had handed to him."
"237",2344,""
"238",2344,"""The string is exceedingly interesting,"" he remarked, holding it up to"
"239",2344,"the light and sniffing at it.  ""What do you make of this string,"
"240",2344,"Lestrade?"""
"241",2344,""
"242",2344,"""It has been tarred."""
"243",2344,""
"244",2344,"""Precisely.  It is a piece of tarred twine.  You have also, no doubt,"
"245",2344,"remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a scissors, as can be"
"246",2344,"seen by the double fray on each side.  This is of importance."""
"247",2344,""
"248",2344,"""I cannot see the importance,"" said Lestrade."
"249",2344,""
"250",2344,"""The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and that"
"251",2344,"this knot is of a peculiar character."""
"252",2344,""
"253",2344,"""It is very neatly tied.  I had already made a note of that effect,"""

"255",2344,""
"256",2344,"""So much for the string, then,"" said Holmes, smiling, ""now for the box"
"257",2344,"wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What, did you"
"258",2344,"not observe it?  I think there can be no doubt of it.  Address printed"
"259",2344,"in rather straggling characters:  'Miss S. Cushing, Cross Street,"
"260",2344,"Croydon.'  Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J, and with very"
"261",2344,"inferior ink.  The word 'Croydon' has been originally spelled with an"
"262",2344,"'i', which has been changed to 'y'.  The parcel was directed, then, by"
"263",2344,"a man--the printing is distinctly masculine--of limited education and"
"264",2344,"unacquainted with the town of Croydon.  So far, so good!  The box is a"
"265",2344,"yellow, half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two"
"266",2344,"thumb marks at the left bottom corner.  It is filled with rough salt of"
"267",2344,"the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser"
"268",2344,"commercial purposes.  And embedded in it are these very singular"
"269",2344,"enclosures."""
"270",2344,""
"271",2344,"He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his"
"272",2344,"knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward"
"273",2344,"on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and"
"274",2344,"at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion.  Finally he returned"
"275",2344,"them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation."
"276",2344,""
"277",2344,"""You have observed, of course,"" said he at last, ""that the ears are not"
"278",2344,"a pair."""
"279",2344,""
"280",2344,"""Yes, I have noticed that.  But if this were the practical joke of some"
"281",2344,"students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for them to"
"282",2344,"send two odd ears as a pair."""
"283",2344,""
"284",2344,"""Precisely.  But this is not a practical joke."""

"286",2344,"""You are sure of it?"""
"287",2344,""
"288",2344,"""The presumption is strongly against it.  Bodies in the"
"289",2344,"dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid.  These ears bear"
"290",2344,"no signs of this.  They are fresh, too.  They have been cut off with a"
"291",2344,"blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a student had done it."
"292",2344,"Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which"
"293",2344,"would suggest themselves to the medical mind, certainly not rough salt."
"294",2344,"I repeat that there is no practical joke here, but that we are"
"295",2344,"investigating a serious crime."""
"296",2344,""
"297",2344,"A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion's words and"
"298",2344,"saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This brutal"
"299",2344,"preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror"
"300",2344,"in the background. Lestrade, however, shook his head like a man who is"
"301",2344,"only half convinced."
"302",2344,""
"303",2344,"""There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,"" said he, ""but"
"304",2344,"there are much stronger reasons against the other.  We know that this"
"305",2344,"woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at Penge and here for"
"306",2344,"the last twenty years.  She has hardly been away from her home for a"
"307",2344,"day during that time.  Why on earth, then, should any criminal send her"
"308",2344,"the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most consummate"
"309",2344,"actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as we do?"""
"310",2344,""
"311",2344,"""That is the problem which we have to solve,"" Holmes answered, ""and for"
"312",2344,"my part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct,"
"313",2344,"and that a double murder has been committed.  One of these ears is a"
"314",2344,"woman's, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring.  The other"
"315",2344,"is a man's, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for an earring."
"316",2344,"These two people are presumably dead, or we should have heard their"
"317",2344,"story before now.  To-day is Friday.  The packet was posted on Thursday"
"318",2344,"morning.  The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or"
"319",2344,"earlier.  If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would"
"320",2344,"have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing?  We may take it that"
"321",2344,"the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he must have some"
"322",2344,"strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this packet.  What reason then?"
"323",2344,"It must have been to tell her that the deed was done! or to pain her,"
"324",2344,"perhaps.  But in that case she knows who it is.  Does she know?  I"
"325",2344,"doubt it.  If she knew, why should she call the police in?  She might"
"326",2344,"have buried the ears, and no one would have been the wiser. That is"
"327",2344,"what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal.  But"
"328",2344,"if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name.  There is a"
"329",2344,"tangle here which needs straightening out.""  He had been talking in a"
"330",2344,"high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but now he"
"331",2344,"sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house."
"332",2344,""
"333",2344,"""I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,"" said he."

"347",2344,"several times to the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he simply laughs"

"356",2344,"though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he"
"357",2344,"had become as demure as ever.  I stared hard myself at her flat,"

"531",2344,"an absolutely blank mind, which is always an advantage.  We had formed"
"532",2344,"no theories.  We were simply there to observe and to draw inferences"
"533",2344,"from our observations.  What did we see first?  A very placid and"
"534",2344,"respectable lady, who seemed quite innocent of any secret, and a"
"535",2344,"portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters.  It"
"536",2344,"instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for"
"537",2344,"one of these.  I set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or"
"538",2344,"confirmed at our leisure.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember,"
"539",2344,"and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box."
"540",2344,""
"541",2344,"""The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers aboard"
"542",2344,"ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our"
"543",2344,"investigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which is popular"
"544",2344,"with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port, and that the"
"545",2344,"male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among"
"546",2344,"sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that all the actors in the"
"547",2344,"tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes."
"548",2344,""
"549",2344,"""When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that it"
"550",2344,"was to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the oldest sister would, of course, be"
"551",2344,"Miss Cushing, and although her initial was 'S' it might belong to one"
"552",2344,"of the others as well.  In that case we should have to commence our"
"553",2344,"investigation from a fresh basis altogether.  I therefore went into the"
"554",2344,"house with the intention of clearing up this point.  I was about to"
"555",2344,"assure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been made"
"556",2344,"when you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop.  The fact was"
"557",2344,"that I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the"
"558",2344,"same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely."
"559",2344,""
"560",2344,"""As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of the"
"561",2344,"body which varies so much as the human ear.  Each ear is as a rule"
"562",2344,"quite distinctive and differs from all other ones.  In last year's"
"563",2344,"Anthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my pen"
"564",2344,"upon the subject.  I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box with"
"565",2344,"the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical"
"566",2344,"peculiarities.  Imagine my surprise, then, when on looking at Miss"
"567",2344,"Cushing I perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female"
"568",2344,"ear which I had just inspected.  The matter was entirely beyond"
"569",2344,"coincidence.  There was the same shortening of the pinna, the same"
"570",2344,"broad curve of the upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner"
"571",2344,"cartilage.  In all essentials it was the same ear."
"572",2344,""
"573",2344,"""In the first place, her sister's name was Sarah, and her address had"
"574",2344,"until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious how the"
"575",2344,"mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant. Then we heard"
"576",2344,"of this steward, married to the third sister, and learned that he had"
"577",2344,"at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah that she had actually gone"
"578",2344,"up to Liverpool to be near the Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards"
"579",2344,"divided them.  This quarrel had put a stop to all communications for"
"580",2344,"some months, so that if Browner had occasion to address a packet to"
"581",2344,"Miss Sarah, he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address."
"582",2344,""
"583",2344,"""And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully.  We"
"584",2344,"had learned of the existence of this steward, an impulsive man, of"
"585",2344,"strong passions--you remember that he threw up what must have been a"
"586",2344,"very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife--subject, too, to"
"587",2344,"occasional fits of hard drinking. We had reason to believe that his"
"588",2344,"wife had been murdered, and that a man--presumably a seafaring man--had"
"589",2344,"been murdered at the same time.  Jealousy, of course, at once suggests"
"590",2344,"itself as the motive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the"
"591",2344,"deed be sent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  Probably because during her"
"592",2344,"residence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events"
"593",2344,"which led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line of boats"
"594",2344,"call at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that Browner"
"595",2344,"had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer, the"
"596",2344,"May Day, Belfast would be the first place at which he could post his"
"597",2344,"terrible packet."

"599",2344,"""A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and although I"
"600",2344,"thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to elucidate it"
"601",2344,"before going further.  An unsuccessful lover might have killed Mr. and"
"602",2344,"Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have belonged to the husband."
"603",2344,"There were many grave objections to this theory, but it was"
"604",2344,"conceivable.  I therefore sent off a telegram to my friend Algar, of"
"605",2344,"the Liverpool force, and asked him to find out if Mrs. Browner were at"
"606",2344,"home, and if Browner had departed in the May Day.  Then we went on to"
"607",2344,"Wallington to visit Miss Sarah."
"608",2344,""
"609",2344,"""I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear had"
"610",2344,"been reproduced in her.  Then, of course, she might give us very"
"611",2344,"important information, but I was not sanguine that she would.  She must"
"612",2344,"have heard of the business the day before, since all Croydon was"
"613",2344,"ringing with it, and she alone could have understood for whom the"
"614",2344,"packet was meant.  If she had been willing to help justice she would"
"615",2344,"probably have communicated with the police already.  However, it was"
"616",2344,"clearly our duty to see her, so we went.  We found that the news of the"
"617",2344,"arrival of the packet--for her illness dated from that time--had such"
"618",2344,"an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever.  It was clearer than"
"619",2344,"ever that she understood its full significance, but equally clear that"
"620",2344,"we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her."

"625",2344,"been closed for more than three days, and the neighbours were of"
"626",2344,"opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives.  It had been"
"627",2344,"ascertained at the shipping offices that Browner had left aboard of the"

"651",2344,"He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy--something"

"2965",3289,"warlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served"
"2966",3289,"the humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there,"
"2967",3289,"and lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth,"
"2968",3289,"round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it,"

"2976",3289,"right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but"
"2977",3289,"actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus"
"2978",3289,"renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted"

"5094",3289,"other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which"
"5095",3289,"would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near"
"5096",3289,"and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that"
"5097",3289,"something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at least worth"
"5098",3289,"testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the"
"5099",3289,"crook of Dr. Watson's umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and"

"5105",3289,"of course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most"

"5114",3289,"pair of boots. ""American, as you perceive,"" he remarked, pointing to"
"5115",3289,"the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife."

"5236",3289,"""Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views"
"5237",3289,"of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I"
"5238",3289,"invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray what"
"5239",3289,"more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at"

"5241",3289,"been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the"
"5242",3289,"bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible."
"5243",3289,"Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be,"
"5244",3289,"and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife"
"5245",3289,"and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences"
"5246",3289,"for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final"
"5247",3289,"escape."""

"5261",3289,"me. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in"
"5262",3289,"this world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they"
"5263",3289,"chased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this"
"5264",3289,"quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable."

"5270",3289,"seen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she"
"5271",3289,"knew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened"
"5272",3289,"there was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything now,"

"5279",3289,"a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted"
"5280",3289,"who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all--one who has"
"5281",3289,"been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I"
"5282",3289,"knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I"
"5283",3289,"guessed I'd fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb"

"5294",3289,"more than most in my time--there is a kind of sixth sense that waves"

"5302",3289,"sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the"
"5303",3289,"hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the floor. He"
"5304",3289,"dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he'd got"
"5305",3289,"his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had got hold of"
"5306",3289,"it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it"

"5313",3289,"was, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I'd recognized"
"5314",3289,"him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother"

"5338",3289,"put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We tied all his"
"5339",3289,"things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only weight I could"

"8631",3289,"to be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the"
"8632",3289,"centre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were"
"8633",3289,"windows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which drew"
"8634",3289,"across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have struck"
"8635",3289,"him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its"
"8636",3289,"distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he discussed"
"8637",3289,"the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an"
"8638",3289,"inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of"
"8639",3289,"his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which"
"8640",3289,"he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly what"
