"26",863,""
"27",863,"The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time"
"28",863,"as ""The Styles Case"" has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in view of"
"29",863,"the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked, both by"
"30",863,"my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account of the"
"31",863,"whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the sensational"
"32",863,"rumours which still persist."
"33",863,""
"34",863,"I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my"
"35",863,"being connected with the affair."
"36",863,""
"37",863,"I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some"
"38",863,"months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month's"
"39",863,"sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make"
"40",863,"up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very"
"41",863,"little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him particularly"
"42",863,"well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he"
"43",863,"hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though, I had often stayed"
"44",863,"at Styles, his mother's place in Essex."
"45",863,""
"46",863,"We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me down"
"47",863,"to Styles to spend my leave there."
"48",863,""
"49",863,"""The mater will be delighted to see you again--after all those years,"""
"50",863,"he added."
"51",863,""
"52",863,"""Your mother keeps well?"" I asked."
"53",863,""
"54",863,"""Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?"""
"55",863,""
"56",863,"I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who had"
"57",863,"married John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a"
"58",863,"handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could"
"59",863,"not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,"
"60",863,"autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social"
"61",863,"notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady"
"62",863,"Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable"
"63",863,"fortune of her own."
"64",863,""
"65",863,"Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish"
"66",863,"early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife's"
"67",863,"ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her"
"68",863,"lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that"
"69",863,"was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had"
"70",863,"always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the"
"71",863,"time of their father's remarriage that they always thought of her as"
"72",863,"their own mother."
"73",863,""
"74",863,"Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a"
"75",863,"doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at"
"76",863,"home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any"
"77",863,"marked success."
"78",863,""
"79",863,"John practiced for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled"
"80",863,"down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married"
"81",863,"two years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I"
"82",863,"entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother"
"83",863,"to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home"
"84",863,"of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her"
"85",863,"own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this"
"86",863,"case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings."
"87",863,""
"88",863,"John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage and"
"89",863,"smiled rather ruefully."
"90",863,""
"91",863,"""Rotten little bounder too!"" he said savagely. ""I can tell you,"
"92",863,"Hastings, it's making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie--you"
"93",863,"remember Evie?"""
"94",863,""
"95",863,"""No."""
"96",863,""
"97",863,"""Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She's the mater's factotum,"
"98",863,"companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport--old Evie! Not precisely"
"99",863,"young and beautiful, but as game as they make them."""
"100",863,""
"101",863,"""You were going to say----?"""
"102",863,""
"103",863,"""Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being"
"104",863,"a second cousin or something of Evie's, though she didn't seem"
"105",863,"particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an"
"106",863,"absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He's got a great black beard,"
"107",863,"and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned"
"108",863,"to him at once, took him on as secretary--you know how she's always"
"109",863,"running a hundred societies?"""
"110",863,""
"111",863,"I nodded."
"112",863,""
"113",863,"""Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No"
"114",863,"doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us"
"115",863,"all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced"
"116",863,"that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty"
"117",863,"years younger than she is! It's simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but"
"118",863,"there you are--she is her own mistress, and she's married him."""
"119",863,""
"120",863,"""It must be a difficult situation for you all."""
"121",863,""
"122",863,"""Difficult! It's damnable!"""
"123",863,""
"124",863,"Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at"
"125",863,"Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for"
"126",863,"existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes."
"127",863,"John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the"
"128",863,"car."
"129",863,""
"130",863,"""Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,"" he remarked. ""Mainly owing"
"131",863,"to the mater's activities."""
"132",863,""
"133",863,"The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the"
"134",863,"little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was"
"135",863,"a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex"
"136",863,"country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it seemed"
"137",863,"almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great war was"
"138",863,"running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another"
"139",863,"world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:"
"140",863,""
"141",863,"""I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings."""
"142",863,""
"143",863,"""My dear fellow, that's just what I want."""
"144",863,""
"145",863,"""Oh, it's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill"
"146",863,"with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife"
"147",863,"works regularly 'on the land'. She is up at five every morning to milk,"
"148",863,"and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It's a jolly good life taking"
"149",863,"it all round--if it weren't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!"" He"
"150",863,"checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. ""I wonder if we've"
"151",863,"time to pick up Cynthia. No, she'll have started from the hospital by"
"152",863,"now."""
"153",863,""
"154",863,"""Cynthia! That's not your wife?"""
"155",863,""
"156",863,"""No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother's, the daughter of an old"
"157",863,"schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a"
"158",863,"cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came"
"159",863,"to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She"
"160",863,"works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away."""
"161",863,""
"162",863,"As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house."
"163",863,"A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,"
"164",863,"straightened herself at our approach."
"165",863,""
"166",863,"""Hullo, Evie, here's our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings--Miss Howard."""
"167",863,""
"168",863,"Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had"
"169",863,"an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a"
"170",863,"pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly"
"171",863,"in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet"
"172",863,"to match--these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation, I"
"173",863,"soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style."
"174",863,""
"175",863,"""Weeds grow like house afire. Can't keep even with 'em. Shall press you"
"176",863,"in. Better be careful."""
"177",863,""
"178",863,"""I'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,"" I"
"179",863,"responded."
"180",863,""
"181",863,"""Don't say it. Never does. Wish you hadn't later."""
"182",863,""
"183",863,"""You're a cynic, Evie,"" said John, laughing. ""Where's tea to-day--inside"
"184",863,"or out?"""
"185",863,""
"186",863,"""Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house."""
"187",863,""
"188",863,"""Come on then, you've done enough gardening for to-day. 'The labourer is"
"189",863,"worthy of his hire', you know. Come and be refreshed."""
"190",863,""
"191",863,"""Well,"" said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, ""I'm"
"192",863,"inclined to agree with you."""
"193",863,""
"194",863,"She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade"
"195",863,"of a large sycamore."
"196",863,""
"197",863,"A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to"
"198",863,"meet us."
"199",863,""
"200",863,"""My wife, Hastings,"" said John."
"201",863,""
"202",863,"I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall, slender"
"203",863,"form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering"
"204",863,"fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes"
"205",863,"of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman's that I"
"206",863,"have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed, which"
"207",863,"nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an"
"208",863,"exquisitely civilised body--all these things are burnt into my memory. I"
"209",863,"shall never forget them."
"210",863,""
"211",863,"She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear"
"212",863,"voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had"
"213",863,"accepted John's invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and her"
"214",863,"few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly"
"215",863,"fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and"
"216",863,"I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent"
"217",863,"Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. John,"
"218",863,"of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant"
"219",863,"conversationalist."
"220",863,""
"221",863,"At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French"
"222",863,"window near at hand:"
"223",863,""
"224",863,"""Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to Lady"
"225",863,"Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear"
"226",863,"from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open"
"227",863,"it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there's the"
"228",863,"Duchess--about the school fete."""
"229",863,""
"230",863,"There was the murmur of a man's voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp's rose"
"231",863,"in reply:"
"232",863,""
"233",863,"""Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,"
"234",863,"Alfred dear."""
"235",863,""
"236",863,"The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome white-haired"
"237",863,"old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features, stepped out of"
"238",863,"it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of deference in his"
"239",863,"manner."
"240",863,""
"241",863,"Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion."
"242",863,""
"243",863,"""Why, if it isn't too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after"
"244",863,"all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings--my husband."""
"245",863,""
"246",863,"I looked with some curiosity at ""Alfred darling"". He certainly struck a"
"247",863,"rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard."
"248",863,"It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore"
"249",863,"gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It"
"250",863,"struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out"
"251",863,"of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He placed"
"252",863,"a wooden hand in mine and said:"
"253",863,""
"254",863,"""This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings."" Then, turning to his wife: ""Emily"
"255",863,"dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp."""
"256",863,""
"257",863,"She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every"
"258",863,"demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwise"
"259",863,"sensible woman!"
"260",863,""
"261",863,"With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled"
"262",863,"hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in"
"263",863,"particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,"
"264",863,"however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I"
"265",863,"remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she"
"266",863,"poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the"
"267",863,"forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place"
"268",863,"shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of"
"269",863,"days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the"
"270",863,"very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself"
"271",863,"that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd."
"272",863,""
"273",863,"Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters"
"274",863,"to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice:"
"275",863,""
"276",863,"""Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?"""
"277",863,""
"278",863,"""No, before the war I was in Lloyd's."""
"279",863,""
"280",863,"""And you will return there after it is over?"""
"281",863,""
"282",863,"""Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether."""
"283",863,""
"284",863,"Mary Cavendish leant forward."

"288",863,""
"289",863,"""Well, that depends."""
"290",863,""
"291",863,"""No secret hobby?"" she asked. ""Tell me--you're drawn to something? Every"
"292",863,"one is--usually something absurd."""
"293",863,""
"294",863,"""You'll laugh at me."""
"295",863,""

"303",863,""
"304",863,"""Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully"
"305",863,"drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous"
"306",863,"detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow."
"307",863,"He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method."
"308",863,"My system is based on his--though of course I have progressed rather"
"309",863,"further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but wonderfully"
"310",863,"clever."""
"311",863,""
"312",863,"""Like a good detective story myself,"" remarked Miss Howard. ""Lots of"

"324",863,"""Of course I should. Mightn't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers."

"761",863,"one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of"
"762",863,"his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have"
"763",863,"caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified"
"764",863,"little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his"
"765",863,"time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As"
"766",863,"a detective, his flair had been extraordinary, and he had achieved"
"767",863,"triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day."

"963",863,"""What's the matter?"" I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect"

"4082",863,"kind, where the murder's only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A lot"
"4083",863,"depends on being on the spot first thing, and that's where Mr. Poirot's"
"4084",863,"had the start of us. We shouldn't have been here as soon as this even,"
"4085",863,"if it hadn't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the"
"4086",863,"spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you've been on the"
"4087",863,"spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little hints. From"
"4088",863,"the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as"
"4089",863,"I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I'd laugh in"

"4210",863,"forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe that any man could"

"4251",863,"initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all"
"4252",863,"that is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his"
"4253",863,"eyes--those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,"
"4254",863,"what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from"
"4255",863,"himself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it"
"4256",863,"on someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand."

"4260",863,"the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr."
"4261",863,"Inglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never"
"4262",863,"actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in"

"4271",863,"him see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something"

"7600",863,"something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in"
"7601",863,"consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper was"
"7602",863,"thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document"
"7603",863,"such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in Mrs."
"7604",863,"Inglethorp's room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy"
"7605",863,"some important document--possibly a will. So the discovery of the"
"7606",863,"charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of"
"7607",863,"course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made"
"7608",863,"this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell"
"7609",863,"into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's"
"7610",863,"determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the"
"7611",863,"quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took"
"7612",863,"place after, and not before the making of the will."

"7614",863,"""Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea."

"7618",863,"I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were addressed,"
"7619",863,"not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At 5 o'clock, an hour"

"7621",863,"She admits to Dorcas, 'I don't know what to do; scandal between husband"
"7622",863,"and wife is a dreadful thing.' At 4 o'clock she has been angry, but"
"7623",863,"completely mistress of herself. At 5 o'clock she is in violent distress,"

"7625",863,""
"7626",863,"""Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I"

"7628",863,"same as the first--and it concerned herself!"
"7629",863,""
"7630",863,"""Let us reconstruct. At 4 o'clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with"
"7631",863,"her son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife--who, by the"
"7632",863,"way, overheard the greater part of the conversation. At 4.30, Mrs."
"7633",863,"Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,"
"7634",863,"makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness."

"7636",863,"agitation, with a slip of paper--'a letter,' Dorcas thinks--in her"
"7637",863,"hand, and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted."
"7638",863,"Presumably, then, between 4.30 and 5 o'clock, something has occurred to"
"7639",863,"occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now as anxious"
"7640",863,"to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was that"
"7641",863,"something?"
"7642",863,""
"7643",863,"""As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody"
"7644",863,"entered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change of"
"7645",863,"sentiment?"
"7646",863,""
"7647",863,"""One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs."
"7648",863,"Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she"
"7649",863,"asked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room"
"7650",863,"stood her husband's desk--locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,"
"7651",863,"and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk."
"7652",863,"That one of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in"
"7653",863,"searching for the stamps she came across something else--that slip of"
"7654",863,"paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant"
"7655",863,"for Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed"
"7656",863,"that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously"
"7657",863,"was a written proof of her own husband's infidelity. She demanded it"
"7658",863,"from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing"
"7659",863,"to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought"
"7660",863,"that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is"
"7661",863,"a very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly"
"7662",863,"jealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all"
"7663",863,"costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to"
"7664",863,"pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp's despatch-case, which had been"
"7665",863,"lost that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all"

"8350",863,"he said. ""I have brought him back to you."" He had stood aside, and as"
"8351",863,"I went out I had seen the look in Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had"
"8352",863,"caught his wife in his arms."
"8353",863,""

"8367",863,"""Yes?"""
"8368",863,""
"8369",863,"Cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly"
"8370",863,"exclaiming: ""You dears!"" kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed out"
"8371",863,"of the room again."
"8372",863,""
"8373",863,"""What on earth does this mean?"" I asked, surprised."
"8374",863,""
"8375",863,"It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the"
"8376",863,"salute rather impaired the pleasure."
"8377",863,""
"8378",863,"""It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike her"

"8389",863,""
"8390",863,"Lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry"

"8482",1155,"PROLOGUE"
"8483",1155,""
"8484",1155,"IT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7, 1915. The _Lusitania_ had been"
"8485",1155,"struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while"
"8486",1155,"the boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and"
"8487",1155,"children were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung"
"8488",1155,"desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children"
"8489",1155,"closely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from"
"8490",1155,"the rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem"
"8491",1155,"afraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead."
"8492",1155,""
"8493",1155,"I beg your pardon."
"8494",1155,""
"8495",1155,"A mans voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the"
"8496",1155,"speaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had"
"8497",1155,"been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination."
"8498",1155,"He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the"
"8499",1155,"overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a"
"8500",1155,"swift, suspicious glance."
"8501",1155,""
"8502",1155,"She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of"
"8503",1155,"perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering"
"8504",1155,"fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be"
"8505",1155,"afraid to meet death!"
"8506",1155,""
"8507",1155,"Yes? Her grave eyes met his inquiringly."
"8508",1155,""
"8509",1155,"He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution."
"8510",1155,""
"8511",1155,"It must be! he muttered to himself. Yes--it is the only way. Then"
"8512",1155,"aloud he said abruptly: You are an American?"
"8513",1155,""
"8514",1155,"Yes."
"8515",1155,""
"8516",1155,"A patriotic one?"
"8517",1155,""
"8518",1155,"The girl flushed."
"8519",1155,""
"8520",1155,"I guess youve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!"
"8521",1155,""
"8522",1155,"Dont be offended. You wouldnt be if you knew how much there was at"
"8523",1155,"stake. But Ive got to trust some one--and it must be a woman."
"8524",1155,""
"8525",1155,"Why?"
"8526",1155,""
"8527",1155,"Because of women and children first. He looked round and lowered his"
"8528",1155,"voice. Im carrying papers--vitally important papers. They may make all"
"8529",1155,"the difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers"
"8530",1155,"have _got_ to be saved! Theyve more chance with you than with me. Will"
"8531",1155,"you take them?"
"8532",1155,""
"8533",1155,"The girl held out her hand."
"8534",1155,""
"8535",1155,"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if Ive been followed. I"
"8536",1155,"dont think I have, but one never knows. If so, there will be danger."
"8537",1155,"Have you the nerve to go through with it?"
"8538",1155,""
"8539",1155,"The girl smiled."
"8540",1155,""
"8541",1155,"Ill go through with it all right. And Im real proud to be chosen!"
"8542",1155,"What am I to do with them afterwards?"
"8543",1155,""
"8544",1155,"Watch the newspapers! Ill advertise in the personal column of the"
"8545",1155,"_Times_, beginning Shipmate. At the end of three days if theres"
"8546",1155,"nothing--well, youll know Im down and out. Then take the packet to"
"8547",1155,"the American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassadors own hands. Is"
"8548",1155,"that clear?"
"8549",1155,""
"8550",1155,"Quite clear."
"8551",1155,""
"8552",1155,"Then be ready--Im going to say good-bye. He took her hand in his."
"8553",1155,"Good-bye. Good luck to you, he said in a louder tone."
"8554",1155,""
"8555",1155,"Her hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm."
"8556",1155,""
"8557",1155,"The _Lusitania_ settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer"
"8558",1155,"to a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat."

"8564",1155,"TOMMY, old thing!"
"8565",1155,""
"8566",1155,"Tuppence, old bean!"
"8567",1155,""
"8568",1155,"The two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily"
"8569",1155,"blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective old"
"8570",1155," was misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled"
"8571",1155,"forty-five."
"8572",1155,""
"8573",1155,"Not seen you for simply centuries, continued the young man. Where are"
"8574",1155,"you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. Were getting a bit unpopular"
"8575",1155,"here--blocking the gangway as it were. Lets get out of it."
"8576",1155,""
"8577",1155,"The girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards"
"8578",1155,"Piccadilly."
"8579",1155,""
"8580",1155,"Now then, said Tommy, where shall we go?"
"8581",1155,""
"8582",1155,"The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute"
"8583",1155,"ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some"
"8584",1155,"mysterious reason as Tuppence. She pounced at once."
"8585",1155,""
"8586",1155,"Tommy, youre stony!"
"8587",1155,""
"8588",1155,"Not a bit of it, declared Tommy unconvincingly. Rolling in cash."
"8589",1155,""
"8590",1155,"You always were a shocking liar, said Tuppence severely, though you"
"8591",1155,"did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer"
"8592",1155,"as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?"
"8593",1155,""
"8594",1155,"Tommy chuckled."
"8595",1155,""
"8596",1155,"I should think I did! Wasnt the old cat in a rage when she found"
"8597",1155,"out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old"
"8598",1155,"hospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?"
"8599",1155,""
"8600",1155,"Tuppence sighed."
"8601",1155,""
"8602",1155,"Yes. You too?"
"8603",1155,""
"8604",1155,"Tommy nodded."
"8605",1155,""
"8606",1155,"Two months ago."
"8607",1155,""
"8608",1155,"Gratuity? hinted Tuppence."
"8609",1155,""
"8610",1155,"Spent."
"8611",1155,""
"8612",1155,"Oh, Tommy!"
"8613",1155,""
"8614",1155,"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of"
"8615",1155,"living--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if"
"8616",1155,"you do not know----"
"8617",1155,""
"8618",1155,"My dear child, interrupted Tuppence, there is nothing I do _not_ know"
"8619",1155,"about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons, and we will each of us"
"8620",1155,"pay for our own. Thats it! And Tuppence led the way upstairs."
"8621",1155,""
"8622",1155,"The place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,"
"8623",1155,"catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so."
"8624",1155,""
"8625",1155,"And--do you know, she sat down and _cried_ when I told her she couldnt"
"8626",1155,"have the flat after all. It was simply a _bargain_, my dear! Just like"
"8627",1155,"the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----"
"8628",1155,""
"8629",1155,"Funny scraps one does overhear, murmured Tommy. I passed two Johnnies"
"8630",1155,"in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you"
"8631",1155,"ever hear such a name?"
"8632",1155,""
"8633",1155,"But at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and"
"8634",1155,"Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats."
"8635",1155,""
"8636",1155,"Tommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast."
"8637",1155,""
"8638",1155,"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots, she added severely."
"8639",1155,""
"8640",1155,"Tommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock"
"8641",1155,"of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly"
"8642",1155,"ugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a"
"8643",1155,"sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of"
"8644",1155,"its tether."
"8645",1155,""
"8646",1155,"They were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there."
"8647",1155,"Tuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in"
"8648",1155,"the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large,"
"8649",1155,"wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black"
"8650",1155,"brows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair,"
"8651",1155,"and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of"
"8652",1155,"uncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at"
"8653",1155,"smartness."
"8654",1155,""
"8655",1155,"The tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of"
"8656",1155,"meditation, poured it out."
"8657",1155,""
"8658",1155,"Now then, said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, lets get"
"8659",1155,"up-to-date. Remember, I havent seen you since that time in hospital in"
"8660",1155,"1916."
"8661",1155,""
"8662",1155,"Very well. Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast."
"8663",1155,"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of"
"8664",1155,"Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the"
"8665",1155,"delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up"
"8666",1155,"to London, where she entered an officers hospital. First month: Washed"
"8667",1155,"up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted"
"8668",1155,"to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes."
"8669",1155,"Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:"
"8670",1155,"Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth"
"8671",1155,"month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance"
"8672",1155,"and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters!"
"8673",1155,"Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhavens"
"8674",1155,"egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important"
"8675",1155,"matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the"
"8676",1155,"mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I"
"8677",1155,"found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow,"
"8678",1155,"Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was"
"8679",1155,"affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in"
"8680",1155,"company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant"
"8681",1155,"Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties"
"8682",1155,"resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a"
"8683",1155,"blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively"
"8684",1155,"a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the"
"8685",1155,"pleasantest. He was quite a young general!"
"8686",1155,""
"8687",1155,"What blighter was that? inquired Tommy. Perfectly sickening the way"
"8688",1155,"those brass hats drove from the War Office to the _Savoy_, and from the"
"8689",1155,"_Savoy_ to the War Office!"
"8690",1155,""
"8691",1155,"Ive forgotten his name now, confessed Tuppence. To resume, that was"
"8692",1155,"in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We"
"8693",1155,"had several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a"
"8694",1155,"land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off"
"8695",1155,"my career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the"
"8696",1155,"true limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at"
"8697",1155,"last. Since then Ive been looking for a job. Now then--your turn."
"8698",1155,""
"8699",1155,"Theres not so much promotion in mine, said Tommy regretfully, and a"
"8700",1155,"great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then"
"8701",1155,"they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time,"
"8702",1155,"and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the"
"8703",1155,"Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I"
"8704",1155,"told you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months Ive"
"8705",1155,"been job hunting! There arent any jobs! And, if there were, they"
"8706",1155,"wouldnt give em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business?"
"8707",1155,"Nothing."

"8719",1155,""
"8720",1155,"Again Tommy shook his head."
"8721",1155,""
"8722",1155,"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?"
"8723",1155,""
"8724",1155,"Ive got an old uncle whos more or less rolling, but hes no good."
"8725",1155,""
"8726",1155,"Why not?"
"8727",1155,""
"8728",1155,"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused."
"8729",1155,""
"8730",1155,"I think I remember hearing about it, said Tuppence slowly. You"
"8731",1155,"refused because of your mother----"
"8732",1155,""
"8733",1155,"Tommy flushed."
"8734",1155,""
"8735",1155,"Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was"
"8736",1155,"all she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from her. Just a"
"8737",1155,"bit of spite."
"8738",1155,""
"8739",1155,"Your mothers dead, isnt she? said Tuppence gently."
"8740",1155,""
"8741",1155,"Tommy nodded."
"8742",1155,""
"8743",1155,"Tuppences large grey eyes looked misty."
"8744",1155,""
"8745",1155,"Youre a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it."
"8746",1155,""
"8747",1155,"Rot! said Tommy hastily. Well, thats my position. Im just about"
"8748",1155,"desperate."
"8749",1155,""
"8750",1155,"So am I! Ive hung out as long as I could. Ive touted round. Ive"
"8751",1155,"answered advertisements. Ive tried every mortal blessed thing. Ive"
"8752",1155,"screwed and saved and pinched! But its no good. I shall have to go"
"8753",1155,"home!"
"8754",1155,""
"8755",1155,"Dont you want to?"
"8756",1155,""
"8757",1155,"Of course I dont want to! Whats the good of being sentimental?"
"8758",1155,"Fathers a dear--Im awfully fond of him--but youve no idea how I worry"
"8759",1155,"him! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and"
"8760",1155,"smoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to"
"8761",1155,"him! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see,"
"8762",1155,"there are seven of us at home. Its awful! All housework and mothers"
"8763",1155,"meetings! I have always been the changeling. I dont want to go back,"
"8764",1155,"but--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?"
"8765",1155,""
"8766",1155,"Tommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst"
"8767",1155,"out:"
"8768",1155,""
"8769",1155,"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I"
"8770",1155,"dare say its mercenary of me, but there it is!"
"8771",1155,""
"8772",1155,"Same here, agreed Tommy with feeling."
"8773",1155,""
"8774",1155,"Ive thought over every imaginable way of getting it too, continued"
"8775",1155,"Tuppence. There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make"
"8776",1155,"it. First is ruled out. I havent got any rich elderly relatives. Any"
"8777",1155,"relatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old"
"8778",1155,"ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case"
"8779",1155,"they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them"
"8780",1155,"has ever asked me my name--and quite a lot never said Thank you."
"8781",1155,""
"8782",1155,"There was a pause."
"8783",1155,""
"8784",1155,"Of course, resumed Tuppence, marriage is my best chance. I made up my"
"8785",1155,"mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would!"
"8786",1155,"Im not sentimental, you know. She paused. Come now, you cant say Im"
"8787",1155,"sentimental, she added sharply."
"8788",1155,""
"8789",1155,"Certainly not, agreed Tommy hastily. No one would ever think of"
"8790",1155,"sentiment in connection with you."
"8791",1155,""
"8792",1155,"Thats not very polite, replied Tuppence. But I dare say you mean it"
"8793",1155,"all right. Well, there it is! Im ready and willing--but I never meet"
"8794",1155,"any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am."
"8795",1155,""
"8796",1155,"What about the general? inquired Tommy."
"8797",1155,""
"8798",1155,"I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace, explained Tuppence."
"8799",1155,"No, there it is! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl."
"8800",1155,""
"8801",1155,"Im like you. I dont know any."
"8802",1155,""
"8803",1155,"That doesnt matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a"
"8804",1155,"man in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I cant rush up to him and say:"
"8805",1155,"Look here, youre rich. Id like to know you."
"8806",1155,""
"8807",1155,"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?"
"8808",1155,""
"8809",1155,"Dont be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or"
"8810",1155,"something like that. If she thinks you want to know her shes flattered,"
"8811",1155,"and will manage it for you somehow."
"8812",1155,""
"8813",1155,"You overrate my manly charms, murmured Tommy."
"8814",1155,""
"8815",1155,"On the other hand, proceeded Tuppence, my millionaire would probably"
"8816",1155,"run for his life! No--marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains--to"
"8817",1155,"_make_ money!"
"8818",1155,""
"8819",1155,"Weve tried that, and failed, Tommy reminded her."
"8820",1155,""
"8821",1155,"Weve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the"
"8822",1155,"unorthodox. Tommy, lets be adventurers!"
"8823",1155,""
"8824",1155,"Certainly, replied Tommy cheerfully. How do we begin?"
"8825",1155,""
"8826",1155,"Thats the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might"
"8827",1155,"hire us to commit crimes for them."
"8828",1155,""
"8829",1155,"Delightful, commented Tommy. Especially coming from a clergymans"
"8830",1155,"daughter!"
"8831",1155,""
"8832",1155,"The moral guilt, Tuppence pointed out, would be theirs--not mine. You"
"8833",1155,"must admit that theres a difference between stealing a diamond necklace"
"8834",1155,"for yourself and being hired to steal it."
"8835",1155,""
"8836",1155,"There wouldnt be the least difference if you were caught!"
"8837",1155,""
"8838",1155,"Perhaps not. But I shouldnt be caught. Im so clever."
"8839",1155,""
"8840",1155,"Modesty always was your besetting sin, remarked Tommy."
"8841",1155,""
"8842",1155,"Dont rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business"
"8843",1155,"partnership?"
"8844",1155,""
"8845",1155,"Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?"
"8846",1155,""
"8847",1155,"That was only an illustration. Lets have a--what do you call it in"
"8848",1155,"book-keeping?"
"8849",1155,""
"8850",1155,"Dont know. Never did any."
"8851",1155,""
"8852",1155,"I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on"
"8853",1155,"the debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out. Oh, I know--a"
"8854",1155,"joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in"
"8855",1155,"the middle of musty old figures. Its got an Elizabethan flavour about"
"8856",1155,"it--makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!"
"8857",1155,""
"8858",1155,"Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your"
"8859",1155,"idea, Tuppence?"
"8860",1155,""
"8861",1155,"Its all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in"
"8862",1155,"it."
"8863",1155,""
"8864",1155,"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?"
"8865",1155,""
"8866",1155,"Advertisement, replied Tuppence promptly. Have you got a bit of paper"
"8867",1155,"and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and"
"8868",1155,"powder-puffs."
"8869",1155,""
"8870",1155,"Tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began"
"8871",1155,"writing busily."
"8872",1155,""
"8873",1155,"Shall we begin: Young officer, twice wounded in the war----"
"8874",1155,""
"8875",1155,"Certainly not."
"8876",1155,""
"8877",1155,"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of"
"8878",1155,"thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt"
"8879",1155,"you, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at"
"8880",1155,"all."
"8881",1155,""
"8882",1155,"I dont want to be adopted."
"8883",1155,""
"8884",1155,"I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you!"
"8885",1155,"The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now"
"8886",1155,"listen--hows this? Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do"
"8887",1155,"anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. (We might as well make"
"8888",1155,"that clear from the start.) Then we might add: No reasonable offer"
"8889",1155,"refused--like flats and furniture."
"8890",1155,""
"8891",1155,"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty"
"8892",1155,"_un_reasonable one!"
"8893",1155,""
"8894",1155,"Tommy! Youre a genius! Thats ever so much more chic. No unreasonable"
"8895",1155,"offer refused--if pay is good. Hows that?"
"8896",1155,""
"8897",1155,"I shouldnt mention pay again. It looks rather eager."
"8898",1155,""
"8899",1155,"It couldnt look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now"
"8900",1155,"Ill read it straight through. Two young adventurers for hire. Willing"
"8901",1155,"to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer"
"8902",1155,"refused. How would that strike you if you read it?"
"8903",1155,""
"8904",1155,"It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a"
"8905",1155,"lunatic."
"8906",1155,""
"8907",1155,"Its not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning"
"8908",1155,"Petunia and signed Best Boy. She tore out the leaf and handed it"
"8909",1155,"to Tommy. There you are. _Times_, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so."
"8910",1155,"I expect it will be about five shillings. Heres half a crown for my"
"8911",1155,"share."
"8912",1155,""
"8913",1155,"Tommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red."
"8914",1155,""
"8915",1155,"Shall we really try it? he said at last. Shall we, Tuppence? Just for"
"8916",1155,"the fun of the thing?"
"8917",1155,""
"8918",1155,"Tommy, youre a sport! I knew you would be! Lets drink to success."
"8919",1155," She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups."
"8920",1155,""
"8921",1155,"Heres to our joint venture, and may it prosper!"
"8922",1155,""
"8923",1155,"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.! responded Tommy."
"8924",1155,""
"8925",1155,"They put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose."
"8926",1155,""
"8927",1155,"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel."
"8928",1155,""
"8929",1155,"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the _Ritz_, agreed Tommy with a"
"8930",1155,"grin. Where shall we meet? And when?"
"8931",1155,""
"8932",1155,"Twelve oclock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?"
"8933",1155,""
"8934",1155,"My time is my own, replied Mr. Beresford magnificently."
"8935",1155,""
"8936",1155,"So long, then."
"8937",1155,""
"8938",1155,"Good-bye, old thing."
"8939",1155,""
"8940",1155,"The two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppences hostel"
"8941",1155,"was situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For"
"8942",1155,"reasons of economy she did not take a bus."
"8943",1155,""
"8944",1155,"She was half-way across St. Jamess Park, when a mans voice behind her"
"8945",1155,"made her start."
"8946",1155,""
"8947",1155,"Excuse me, it said. But may I speak to you for a moment?"

"8951",1155,"CHAPTER II. MR. WHITTINGTONS OFFER"
"8952",1155,""
"8953",1155,"TUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue"
"8954",1155,"remained unspoken, for the mans appearance and manner did not bear out"
"8955",1155,"her first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her"
"8956",1155,"thoughts, the man said quickly:"
"8957",1155,""
"8958",1155,"I can assure you I mean no disrespect."
"8959",1155,""
"8960",1155,"Tuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him"
"8961",1155,"instinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive"
"8962",1155,"which she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He"
"8963",1155,"was a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and"
"8964",1155,"cunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze."
"8965",1155,""
"8966",1155,"Well, what is it? she asked."
"8967",1155,""
"8968",1155,"The man smiled."
"8969",1155,""
"8970",1155,"I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young"
"8971",1155,"gentleman in Lyons."
"8972",1155,""
"8973",1155,"Well--what of it?"
"8974",1155,""
"8975",1155,"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you."
"8976",1155,""
"8977",1155,"Another inference forced itself into Tuppences mind:"

"8979",1155,"You followed me here?"
"8980",1155,""
"8981",1155,"I took that liberty."
"8982",1155,""
"8983",1155,"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?"
"8984",1155,""
"8985",1155,"The man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow."
"8986",1155,""
"8987",1155,"Tuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription,"
"8988",1155,"Mr. Edward Whittington. Below the name were the words Esthonia"
"8989",1155,"Glassware Co., and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke"
"8990",1155,"again:"
"8991",1155,""
"8992",1155,"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven oclock, I will"

"8994",1155,""
"8995",1155,"At eleven oclock? said Tuppence doubtfully."

"8997",1155,"At eleven oclock."
"8998",1155,""
"8999",1155,"Tuppence made up her mind."

"9001",1155,"Very well. Ill be there."

"9003",1155,"Thank you. Good evening."
"9004",1155,""
"9005",1155,"He raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained"
"9006",1155,"for some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of"
"9007",1155,"her shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself."
"9008",1155,""
"9009",1155,"The adventures have begun, she murmured to herself. What does he want"
"9010",1155,"me to do, I wonder? Theres something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I"
"9011",1155,"dont like at all. But, on the other hand, Im not the least bit afraid"
"9012",1155,"of you. And as Ive said before, and shall doubtless say again, little"
"9013",1155,"Tuppence can look after herself, thank you!"
"9014",1155,""
"9015",1155,"And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a"
"9016",1155,"result of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct"
"9017",1155,"route and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments,"
"9018",1155,"a telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings"
"9019",1155,"spent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the"
"9020",1155,"waste of ninepence."
"9021",1155,""
"9022",1155,"Disdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent"
"9023",1155,"Government had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommys pencil which she had"
"9024",1155,"retained and wrote rapidly: Dont put in advertisement. Will explain"
"9025",1155,"to-morrow. She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one"
"9026",1155,"short month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted"
"9027",1155,"him to renew his subscription."
"9028",1155,""
"9029",1155,"It may catch him, she murmured. Anyway, its worth trying."
"9030",1155,""
"9031",1155,"After handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping"
"9032",1155,"at a bakers to buy three penny-worth of new buns."
"9033",1155,""
"9034",1155,"Later, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and"

"9036",1155,"earthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of"
"9037",1155,"excitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had"
"9038",1155,"retreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities."
"9039",1155,""
"9040",1155,"It was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when"
"9041",1155,"at length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to"
"9042",1155,"washing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable"
"9043",1155,"resemblance to hospital plates!"
"9044",1155,""

"9046",1155,"of buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were"
"9047",1155,"situated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence"
"9048",1155,"decided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On"
"9049",1155,"the stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building."
"9050",1155,"The Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but"

"9077",1155,"Tuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small"
"9078",1155,"and demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst"
"9079",1155,"Mr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed"
"9080",1155,"them away, and leaned over the desk."
"9081",1155,""
"9082",1155,"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business. His large face"
"9083",1155,"broadened into a smile. You want work? Well, I have work to offer"
"9084",1155,"you. What should you say now to 100 down, and all expenses paid? Mr."
"9085",1155,"Whittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the"
"9086",1155,"arm-holes of his waistcoat."
"9087",1155,""
"9088",1155,"Tuppence eyed him warily."
"9089",1155,""
"9090",1155,"And the nature of the work? she demanded."
"9091",1155,""
"9092",1155,"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all."
"9093",1155,""
"9094",1155,"Where to?"
"9095",1155,""
"9096",1155,"Mr. Whittington smiled again."
"9097",1155,""
"9098",1155,"Paris."
"9099",1155,""
"9100",1155,"Oh! said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: Of course,"
"9101",1155,"if father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I dont see Mr."
"9102",1155,"Whittington in the role of the gay deceiver."
"9103",1155,""
"9104",1155,"Yes, continued Whittington. What could be more delightful? To put the"
"9105",1155,"clock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and re-enter one of those"
"9106",1155,"charming _pensionnats de jeunes filles_ with which Paris abounds----"
"9107",1155,""
"9108",1155,"Tuppence interrupted him."
"9109",1155,""
"9110",1155,"A _pensionnat?_"
"9111",1155,""
"9112",1155,"Exactly. Madame Colombiers in the Avenue de Neuilly."
"9113",1155,""
"9114",1155,"Tuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She"
"9115",1155,"had had several American friends there. She was more than ever puzzled."
"9116",1155,""
"9117",1155,"You want me to go to Madame Colombiers? For how long?"
"9118",1155,""
"9119",1155,"That depends. Possibly three months."
"9120",1155,""
"9121",1155,"And that is all? There are no other conditions?"
"9122",1155,""
"9123",1155,"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward,"
"9124",1155,"and you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have"
"9125",1155,"to request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are"
"9126",1155,"English, are you not?"
"9127",1155,""
"9128",1155,"Yes."
"9129",1155,""
"9130",1155,"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?"
"9131",1155,""
"9132",1155,"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I"
"9133",1155,"picked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again."
"9134",1155,""
"9135",1155,"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American."
"9136",1155,"Details about your past life in England might be more difficult to"
"9137",1155,"sustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then----"
"9138",1155,""
"9139",1155,"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for"
"9140",1155,"granted."
"9141",1155,""
"9142",1155,"Whittington looked surprised."
"9143",1155,""
"9144",1155,"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame"
"9145",1155,"Colombiers is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the"
"9146",1155,"terms are most liberal."
"9147",1155,""
"9148",1155,"Exactly, said Tuppence. Thats just it. The terms are almost too"
"9149",1155,"liberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth"
"9150",1155,"that amount of money to you."
"9151",1155,""
"9152",1155,"No? said Whittington softly. Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless"
"9153",1155,"obtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for"
"9154",1155,"is a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to"
"9155",1155,"sustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion"
"9156",1155,"not to ask too many questions."
"9157",1155,""
"9158",1155,"Tuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored."
"9159",1155,""
"9160",1155,"Theres another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr."
"9161",1155,"Beresford. Where does he come in?"
"9162",1155,""
"9163",1155,"Mr. Beresford?"
"9164",1155,""
"9165",1155,"My partner, said Tuppence with dignity. You saw us together"
"9166",1155,"yesterday."
"9167",1155,""
"9168",1155,"Ah, yes. But Im afraid we shant require his services."
"9169",1155,""
"9170",1155,"Then its off! Tuppence rose. Its both or neither. Sorry--but thats"
"9171",1155,"how it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington."
"9172",1155,""
"9173",1155,"Wait a minute. Let us see if something cant be managed. Sit down"
"9174",1155,"again, Miss---- He paused interrogatively."
"9175",1155,""
"9176",1155,"Tuppences conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the"
"9177",1155,"archdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her"
"9178",1155,"head."
"9179",1155,""
"9180",1155,"Jane Finn, she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the"
"9181",1155,"effect of those two simple words."
"9182",1155,""
"9183",1155,"All the geniality had faded out of Whittingtons face. It was purple"
"9184",1155,"with rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all"
"9185",1155,"there lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed"
"9186",1155,"savagely:"
"9187",1155,""
"9188",1155,"So thats your little game, is it?"
"9189",1155,""
"9190",1155,"Tuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She"
"9191",1155,"had not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally"
"9192",1155,"quick-witted, and felt it imperative to keep her end up as she phrased"
"9193",1155,"it."
"9194",1155,""
"9195",1155,"Whittington went on:"
"9196",1155,""
"9197",1155,"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse?"
"9198",1155,"Knew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that"
"9199",1155,"it, eh? He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face."
"9200",1155,"He eyed her keenly. Whos been blabbing? Rita?"
"9201",1155,""
"9202",1155,"Tuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could"
"9203",1155,"sustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging"
"9204",1155,"an unknown Rita into it."
"9205",1155,""
"9206",1155,"No, she replied with perfect truth. Rita knows nothing about me."
"9207",1155,""
"9208",1155,"His eyes still bored into her like gimlets."
"9209",1155,""
"9210",1155,"How much do you know? he shot out."
"9211",1155,""
"9212",1155,"Very little indeed, answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that"
"9213",1155,"Whittingtons uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have"
"9214",1155,"boasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind."
"9215",1155,""
"9216",1155,"Anyway, snarled Whittington, you knew enough to come in here and"
"9217",1155,"plump out that name."
"9218",1155,""
"9219",1155,"It might be my own name, Tuppence pointed out."
"9220",1155,""
"9221",1155,"Its likely, isnt it, then there would be two girls with a name like"
"9222",1155,"that?"
"9223",1155,""
"9224",1155,"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance, continued Tuppence,"
"9225",1155,"intoxicated with the success of truthfulness."
"9226",1155,""
"9227",1155,"Mr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang."
"9228",1155,""
"9229",1155,"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?"
"9230",1155,""
"9231",1155,"The last five words took Tuppences fancy mightily, especially after a"
"9232",1155,"meagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part"
"9233",1155,"was of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did"
"9234",1155,"not deny its possibilities. She sat up and smiled with the air of one"
"9235",1155,"who has the situation thoroughly well in hand."
"9236",1155,""
"9237",1155,"My dear Mr. Whittington, she said, let us by all means lay our cards"
"9238",1155,"upon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me say yesterday"
"9239",1155,"that I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now"
"9240",1155,"proved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a"
"9241",1155,"certain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there."
"9242",1155,""
"9243",1155,"Yes--and perhaps it doesnt, snarled Whittington."
"9244",1155,""
"9245",1155,"You insist on misjudging me, said Tuppence, and sighed gently."
"9246",1155,""
"9247",1155,"As I said once before, said Whittington angrily, quit fooling, and"
"9248",1155,"come to the point. You cant play the innocent with me. You know a great"
"9249",1155,"deal more than youre willing to admit."
"9250",1155,""
"9251",1155,"Tuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said"
"9252",1155,"softly:"
"9253",1155,""
"9254",1155,"I shouldnt like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington."
"9255",1155,""
"9256",1155,"So we come to the usual question--how much?"
"9257",1155,""
"9258",1155,"Tuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with"
"9259",1155,"complete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken"
"9260",1155,"his suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain."
"9261",1155,""
"9262",1155,"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the"
"9263",1155,"matter later?"
"9264",1155,""
"9265",1155,"Whittington gave her an ugly glance."
"9266",1155,""
"9267",1155,"Blackmail, eh?"
"9268",1155,""
"9269",1155,"Tuppence smiled sweetly."
"9270",1155,""
"9271",1155,"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?"
"9272",1155,""
"9273",1155,"Whittington grunted."
"9274",1155,""
"9275",1155,"You see, explained Tuppence still sweetly, Im so very fond of"
"9276",1155,"money!"
"9277",1155,""
"9278",1155,"Youre about the limit, thats what you are, growled Whittington, with"
"9279",1155,"a sort of unwilling admiration. You took me in all right. Thought you"
"9280",1155,"were quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose."
"9281",1155,""
"9282",1155,"Life, moralized Tuppence, is full of surprises."
"9283",1155,""
"9284",1155,"All the same, continued Whittington, some ones been talking. You say"
"9285",1155,"it isnt Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in."
"9286",1155,""
"9287",1155,"The clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a paper at"
"9288",1155,"his masters elbow."
"9289",1155,""
"9290",1155,"Telephone message just come for you, sir."
"9291",1155,""
"9292",1155,"Whittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his brow."
"9293",1155,""
"9294",1155,"Thatll do, Brown. You can go."
"9295",1155,""
"9296",1155,"The clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington turned to"
"9297",1155,"Tuppence."
"9298",1155,""
"9299",1155,"Come to-morrow at the same time. Im busy now. Heres fifty to go on"
"9300",1155,"with."
"9301",1155,""
"9302",1155,"He rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the table to"
"9303",1155,"Tuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to go."
"9304",1155,""
"9305",1155,"The girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her"
"9306",1155,"handbag, and rose."
"9307",1155,""
"9308",1155,"Good morning, Mr. Whittington, she said politely. At least, au"
"9309",1155,"revoir, I should say."
"9310",1155,""
"9311",1155,"Exactly. Au revoir! Whittington looked almost genial again, a"
"9312",1155,"reversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. Au revoir, my"
"9313",1155,"clever and charming young lady."
"9314",1155,""
"9315",1155,"Tuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A"
"9316",1155,"neighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve."
"9317",1155,""
"9318",1155,"Lets give Tommy a surprise! murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi."
"9319",1155,""
"9320",1155,"The cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the"
"9321",1155,"entrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward"
"9322",1155,"to assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and"
"9323",1155,"remarked in a slightly affected voice:"
"9324",1155,""
"9325",1155,"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? Ive got nothing smaller than a"
"9326",1155,"five-pound note!"
"9327",1155,""
"9328",1155,""
"9329",1155,""
"9330",1155,"CHAPTER III. A SET BACK"
"9331",1155,""
"9332",1155,"THE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To"
"9333",1155,"begin with, the resources of Tommys pockets were somewhat limited. In"
"9334",1155,"the end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence,"
"9335",1155,"and the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his"
"9336",1155,"hand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse"
"9337",1155,"demand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him?"
"9338",1155,""
"9339",1155,"I think youve given him too much, Tommy, said Tuppence innocently. I"
"9340",1155,"fancy he wants to give some of it back."
"9341",1155,""
"9342",1155,"It was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away."
"9343",1155,""
"9344",1155,"Well, said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings,"
"9345",1155,"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?"
"9346",1155,""
"9347",1155,"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting, said Tuppence"
"9348",1155,"gently."
"9349",1155,""
"9350",1155,"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up! said Mr."
"9351",1155,"Beresford."
"9352",1155,""
"9353",1155,"And really and truly, continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide,"
"9354",1155,"I havent got anything smaller than a five-pound note."
"9355",1155,""
"9356",1155,"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the"
"9357",1155,"fellow wasnt taken in--not for a moment!"
"9358",1155,""
"9359",1155,"No, said Tuppence thoughtfully, he didnt believe it. Thats the"
"9360",1155,"curious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found"
"9361",1155,"that out this morning. Now lets go to lunch. How about the _Savoy?_"
"9362",1155,""
"9363",1155,"Tommy grinned."
"9364",1155,""
"9365",1155,"How about the _Ritz?_"
"9366",1155,""
"9367",1155,"On second thoughts, I prefer the _Piccadilly_. Its nearer. We shant"
"9368",1155,"have to take another taxi. Come along."
"9369",1155,""
"9370",1155,"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?"
"9371",1155," inquired Tommy."
"9372",1155,""
"9373",1155,"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and"
"9374",1155,"the shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental"
"9375",1155,"trouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited _Hors duvre_,"
"9376",1155,"Lobster _ lamricane_, Chicken Newberg, and Pche Melba! Lets go"
"9377",1155,"and get them!"
"9378",1155,""
"9379",1155,"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?"
"9380",1155,""
"9381",1155,"Oh, unbelieving one! Tuppence wrenched open her bag. Look here, and"
"9382",1155,"here, and here!"
"9383",1155,""
"9384",1155,"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, dont wave Fishers aloft like that!"
"9385",1155,""
"9386",1155,"Theyre not Fishers. Theyre five times better than Fishers, and this"
"9387",1155,"ones ten times better!"
"9388",1155,""
"9389",1155,"Tommy groaned."
"9390",1155,""
"9391",1155,"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I"
"9392",1155,"really behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in"
"9393",1155,"a dangerous fashion?"
"9394",1155,""
"9395",1155,"Even so, O King! _Now_, will you come and have lunch?"
"9396",1155,""
"9397",1155,"Ill come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?"
"9398",1155,""
"9399",1155,"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is. Theres a"
"9400",1155,"huge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible if they killed the"
"9401",1155,"five-pound notes!"
"9402",1155,""
"9403",1155,"Grill room? inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite pavement in"
"9404",1155,"safety."
"9405",1155,""
"9406",1155,"The others more expensive, demurred Tuppence."
"9407",1155,""
"9408",1155,"Thats mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below."
"9409",1155,""
"9410",1155,"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?"
"9411",1155,""
"9412",1155,"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of course"
"9413",1155,"you can--or as much as is good for you, anyway."
"9414",1155,""
"9415",1155,"And now tell me, said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity"
"9416",1155,"any longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many _hors duvre_"
"9417",1155,"of Tuppences dreams."
"9418",1155,""
"9419",1155,"Miss Cowley told him."
"9420",1155,""
"9421",1155,"And the curious part of it is, she ended, that I really did invent"
"9422",1155,"the name of Jane Finn! I didnt want to give my own because of poor"
"9423",1155,"father--in case I should get mixed up in anything shady."
"9424",1155,""
"9425",1155,"Perhaps thats so, said Tommy slowly. But you didnt invent it."
"9426",1155,""
"9427",1155,"What?"
"9428",1155,""
"9429",1155,"No. _I_ told it to you. Dont you remember, I said yesterday Id"
"9430",1155,"overheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? Thats"
"9431",1155,"what brought the name into your mind so pat."
"9432",1155,""
"9433",1155,"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary---- Tuppence tailed off"
"9434",1155,"into silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. Tommy!"
"9435",1155,""
"9436",1155,"Yes?"
"9437",1155,""
"9438",1155,"What were they like, the two men you passed?"
"9439",1155,""
"9440",1155,"Tommy frowned in an effort at remembrance."
"9441",1155,""
"9442",1155,"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and dark."
"9443",1155,""
"9444",1155,"Thats him, cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. Thats"
"9445",1155,"Whittington! What was the other man like?"
"9446",1155,""
"9447",1155,"I cant remember. I didnt notice him particularly. It was really the"
"9448",1155,"outlandish name that caught my attention."
"9449",1155,""
"9450",1155,"And people say that coincidences dont happen! Tuppence tackled her"
"9451",1155,"Pche Melba happily."
"9452",1155,""
"9453",1155,"But Tommy had become serious."
"9454",1155,""
"9455",1155,"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?"
"9456",1155,""
"9457",1155,"More money, replied his companion."
"9458",1155,""
"9459",1155,"I know that. Youve only got one idea in your head. What I mean is,"
"9460",1155,"what about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?"
"9461",1155,""
"9462",1155,"Oh! Tuppence laid down her spoon. Youre right, Tommy, it is a bit of"
"9463",1155,"a poser."
"9464",1155,""
"9465",1155,"After all, you know, you cant bluff him forever. Youre sure to slip"
"9466",1155,"up sooner or later. And, anyway, Im not at all sure that it isnt"
"9467",1155,"actionable--blackmail, you know."
"9468",1155,""
"9469",1155,"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying youll tell unless you are given"
"9470",1155,"money. Now, theres nothing I could tell, because I dont really know"
"9471",1155,"anything."
"9472",1155,""
"9473",1155,"Hm, said Tommy doubtfully. Well, anyway, what _are_ we going to do?"
"9474",1155,"Whittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time"
"9475",1155,"hell want to know something more before he parts with his money. Hell"
"9476",1155,"want to know how much _you_ know, and where you got your information"
"9477",1155,"from, and a lot of other things that you cant cope with. What are you"
"9478",1155,"going to do about it?"
"9479",1155,""
"9480",1155,"Tuppence frowned severely."
"9481",1155,""
"9482",1155,"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the"
"9483",1155,"brain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!"
"9484",1155,""
"9485",1155,"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but"
"9486",1155,"I flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours."
"9487",1155,"Two coffees. (This was to the waiter.) One Turkish, one French."
"9488",1155,""
"9489",1155,"Tuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed"
"9490",1155,"Tommy when he spoke to her."
"9491",1155,""
"9492",1155,"Be quiet. Im thinking."
"9493",1155,""
"9494",1155,"Shades of Pelmanism! said Tommy, and relapsed into silence."
"9495",1155,""
"9496",1155,"There! said Tuppence at last. Ive got a plan. Obviously what weve"
"9497",1155,"got to do is to find out more about it all."
"9498",1155,""
"9499",1155,"Tommy applauded."
"9500",1155,""
"9501",1155,"Dont jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover"
"9502",1155,"where he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I cant do it,"
"9503",1155,"because he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons."
"9504",1155,"Hes not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like"
"9505",1155,"another."
"9506",1155,""
"9507",1155,"I repudiate that remark utterly. Im sure my pleasing features and"
"9508",1155,"distinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd."
"9509",1155,""
"9510",1155,"My plan is this, Tuppence went on calmly, Ill go alone to-morrow."
"9511",1155,"Ill put him off again like I did to-day. It doesnt matter if I dont"
"9512",1155,"get any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days."
"9513",1155,""
"9514",1155,"Or even longer!"
"9515",1155,""
"9516",1155,"Youll hang about outside. When I come out I shant speak to you in"
"9517",1155,"case hes watching. But Ill take up my stand somewhere near, and when"
"9518",1155,"he comes out of the building Ill drop a handkerchief or something, and"
"9519",1155,"off you go!"
"9520",1155,""
"9521",1155,"Off I go where?"
"9522",1155,""
"9523",1155,"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?"
"9524",1155,""
"9525",1155,"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real"
"9526",1155,"life one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with"
"9527",1155,"nothing to do. People will wonder what Im up to."
"9528",1155,""
"9529",1155,"Not in the city. Every ones in such a hurry. Probably no one will even"
"9530",1155,"notice you at all."
"9531",1155,""
"9532",1155,"Thats the second time youve made that sort of remark. Never mind, I"
"9533",1155,"forgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this"
"9534",1155,"afternoon?"
"9535",1155,""
"9536",1155,"Well, said Tuppence meditatively. I _had_ thought of hats! Or perhaps"
"9537",1155,"silk stockings! Or perhaps----"
"9538",1155,""
"9539",1155,"Hold hard, admonished Tommy. Theres a limit to fifty pounds! But"
"9540",1155,"lets do dinner and a show to-night at all events."
"9541",1155,""
"9542",1155,"Rather."
"9543",1155,""
"9544",1155,"The day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the"
"9545",1155,"five-pound notes were now irretrievably dead."
"9546",1155,""
"9547",1155,"They met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards."
"9548",1155,"Tommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged"
"9549",1155,"into the building."
"9550",1155,""
"9551",1155,"Tommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again."
"9552",1155,"Just as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the"
"9553",1155,"road."
"9554",1155,""
"9555",1155,"Tommy!"
"9556",1155,""
"9557",1155,"Yes. Whats up?"
"9558",1155,""
"9559",1155,"The place is shut. I cant make anyone hear."
"9560",1155,""
"9561",1155,"Thats odd."
"9562",1155,""
"9563",1155,"Isnt it? Come up with me, and lets try again."
"9564",1155,""
"9565",1155,"Tommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk"
"9566",1155,"came out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to"
"9567",1155,"Tuppence."
"9568",1155,""
"9569",1155,"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?"
"9570",1155,""
"9571",1155,"Yes, please."
"9572",1155,""
"9573",1155,"Its closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up,"
"9574",1155,"they say. Not that Ive ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office"
"9575",1155,"is to let."
"9576",1155,""
"9577",1155,"Th--thank you, faltered Tuppence. I suppose you dont know Mr."
"9578",1155,"Whittingtons address?"
"9579",1155,""
"9580",1155,"Afraid I dont. They left rather suddenly."
"9581",1155,""
"9582",1155,"Thank you very much, said Tommy. Come on, Tuppence."
"9583",1155,""
"9584",1155,"They descended to the street again where they gazed at one another"
"9585",1155,"blankly."
"9586",1155,""
"9587",1155,"Thats torn it, said Tommy at length."
"9588",1155,""
"9589",1155,"And I never suspected it, wailed Tuppence."
"9590",1155,""
"9591",1155,"Cheer up, old thing, it cant be helped."
"9592",1155,""
"9593",1155,"Cant it, though! Tuppences little chin shot out defiantly. Do you"
"9594",1155,"think this is the end? If so, youre wrong. Its just the beginning!"
"9595",1155,""
"9596",1155,"The beginning of what?"
"9597",1155,""
"9598",1155,"Of our adventure! Tommy, dont you see, if they are scared enough to"
"9599",1155,"run away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn"
"9600",1155,"business! Well, well get to the bottom of it. Well run them down!"
"9601",1155,"Well be sleuths in earnest!"
"9602",1155,""
"9603",1155,"Yes, but theres no one left to sleuth."
"9604",1155,""
"9605",1155,"No, thats why well have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of"
"9606",1155,"pencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--dont interrupt. There! Tuppence handed"
"9607",1155,"back the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had"
"9608",1155,"written with a satisfied eye:"
"9609",1155,""
"9610",1155,"Whats that?"
"9611",1155,""
"9612",1155,"Advertisement."

"9614",1155,"Youre not going to put that thing in after all?"
"9615",1155,""
"9616",1155,"No, its a different one. She handed him the slip of paper."
"9617",1155,""
"9618",1155,"Tommy read the words on it aloud:"

"9626",1155,"THE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure."
"9627",1155,"Carefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the"
"9628",1155,"weather was fine, and walking is cheap, dictated Tuppence. An outlying"
"9629",1155,"picture house provided them with recreation for the evening."
"9630",1155,""
"9631",1155,"The day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the"

"9635",1155,"He had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters"
"9636",1155,"if they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his"
"9637",1155,"colleague would meet him at ten oclock."
"9638",1155,""
"9639",1155,"Tuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a red"

"9643",1155,"Well?"

"9654",1155,"advertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!"
"9655",1155,""
"9656",1155,"Tommy, you devil! almost screamed Tuppence. Give them to me. How"
"9657",1155,"could you be so mean!"
"9658",1155,""
"9659",1155,"Your language, Tuppence, your language! Theyre very particular at the"
"9660",1155,"National Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have"
"9661",1155,"pointed out to you before, that as a clergymans daughter----"
"9662",1155,""
"9663",1155,"I ought to be on the stage! finished Tuppence with a snap."

"9665",1155,"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have"
"9666",1155,"enjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have"
"9667",1155,"kindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the"
"9668",1155,"saying goes."
"9669",1155,""

"9727",1155,"Carshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence"

"9806",1155,"He paused a moment, and then went on."
"9807",1155,""
"9808",1155,"Well, how about it? Youre out for adventure. How would you like"
"9809",1155,"to work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a"
"9810",1155,"moderate screw?"
"9811",1155,""
"9812",1155,"Tuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and"
"9813",1155,"wider."
"9814",1155,""
"9815",1155,"What should we have to do? she breathed."
"9816",1155,""
"9817",1155,"Mr. Carter smiled."
"9818",1155,""
"9819",1155,"Just go on with what youre doing now. _Find Jane Finn_."
"9820",1155,""
"9821",1155,"Yes, but--who _is_ Jane Finn?"
"9822",1155,""
"9823",1155,"Mr. Carter nodded gravely."
"9824",1155,""
"9825",1155,"Yes, youre entitled to know that, I think."
"9826",1155,""
"9827",1155,"He leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his"
"9828",1155,"fingers together, and began in a low monotone:"
"9829",1155,""
"9830",1155,"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does"
"9831",1155,"not concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of"
"9832",1155,"1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret"
"9833",1155,"agreement--treaty--call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for"
"9834",1155,"signature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America--at"
"9835",1155,"that time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special"
"9836",1155,"messenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It"
"9837",1155,"was hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing"
"9838",1155,"would have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed."
"9839",1155,"Somebody always talks!"
"9840",1155,""
"9841",1155,"Danvers sailed for England on the _Lusitania_. He carried the precious"
"9842",1155,"papers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that"
"9843",1155,"particular voyage that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers"
"9844",1155,"was among the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed"
"9845",1155,"ashore, and identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet"
"9846",1155,"was missing!"
"9847",1155,""
"9848",1155,"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself"
"9849",1155,"passed it on into anothers keeping? There were a few incidents that"
"9850",1155,"strengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo"
"9851",1155,"struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats,"
"9852",1155,"Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually"
"9853",1155,"saw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me"
"9854",1155,"quite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that"
"9855",1155,"she, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore."
"9856",1155,""
"9857",1155,"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?"
"9858",1155,"By later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been"
"9859",1155,"closely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his"
"9860",1155,"enemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or"
"9861",1155,"forced into handing over the precious packet?"
"9862",1155,""
"9863",1155,"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly difficult."
"9864",1155,"Her name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the"
"9865",1155,"survivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely."
"9866",1155,"Inquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan,"
"9867",1155,"and had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small"
"9868",1155,"school out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she"
"9869",1155,"was going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services"
"9870",1155,"voluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted."
"9871",1155,"Having seen her name in the list of the saved from the _Lusitania_, the"
"9872",1155,"staff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving"
"9873",1155,"to take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way."
"9874",1155,""
"9875",1155,"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in vain."
"9876",1155,"We tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after"
"9877",1155,"she set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty--as might"
"9878",1155,"very easily have been done--and we therefore came to the conclusion that"
"9879",1155,"Danvers had, after all, destroyed it. The war entered on another phase,"
"9880",1155,"the diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never"
"9881",1155,"redrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The"
"9882",1155,"disappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost"
"9883",1155,"in oblivion."
"9884",1155,""
"9885",1155,"Mr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:"
"9886",1155,""
"9887",1155,"But why has it all cropped up again? The wars over."
"9888",1155,""
"9889",1155,"A hint of alertness came into Mr. Carters manner."
"9890",1155,""
"9891",1155,"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all, and that"
"9892",1155,"they might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance."
"9893",1155,""
"9894",1155,"Tuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded."
"9895",1155,""
"9896",1155,"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands;"
"9897",1155,"to-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic blunder. If its"
"9898",1155,"terms were made public, it would mean disaster.... It might possibly"
"9899",1155,"bring about another war--not with Germany this time! That is an extreme"
"9900",1155,"possibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that"
"9901",1155,"document undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot"
"9902",1155,"afford to have discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party"
"9903",1155,"cry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government at this"
"9904",1155,"juncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for British trade,"
"9905",1155,"but that is a mere nothing to the _real_ danger."
"9906",1155,""
"9907",1155,"He paused, and then said quietly:"
"9908",1155,""
"9909",1155,"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence"
"9910",1155,"at work behind the present Labour unrest?"
"9911",1155,""
"9912",1155,"Tuppence nodded."
"9913",1155,""
"9914",1155,"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the"
"9915",1155,"specific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is a certain man,"
"9916",1155,"a man whose real name is unknown to us, who is working in the dark for"
"9917",1155,"his own ends. The Bolshevists are behind the Labour unrest--but this"
"9918",1155,"man is _behind the Bolshevists_. Who is he? We do not know. He is always"
"9919",1155,"spoken of by the unassuming title of Mr. Brown. But one thing is"
"9920",1155,"certain, he is the master criminal of this age. He controls a marvellous"
"9921",1155,"organization. Most of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated"
"9922",1155,"and financed by him. His spies are everywhere."
"9923",1155,""
"9924",1155,"A naturalized German? asked Tommy."
"9925",1155,""
"9926",1155,"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman. He"
"9927",1155,"was pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer. What he seeks to attain"
"9928",1155,"we do not know--probably supreme power for himself, of a kind unique in"
"9929",1155,"history. We have no clue as to his real personality. It is reported that"
"9930",1155,"even his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his"
"9931",1155,"tracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes"
"9932",1155,"the chief rle. But afterwards we always find that there has been some"
"9933",1155,"nonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the background"
"9934",1155,"unnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped us once more."
"9935",1155,""
"9936",1155,"Oh! Tuppence jumped. I wonder----"
"9937",1155,""
"9938",1155,"Yes?"
"9939",1155,""
"9940",1155,"I remember in Mr. Whittingtons office. The clerk--he called him Brown."
"9941",1155,"You dont think----"
"9942",1155,""
"9943",1155,"Carter nodded thoughtfully."
"9944",1155,""
"9945",1155,"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned. An"
"9946",1155,"idiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at all?"
"9947",1155,""
"9948",1155,"I really didnt notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone else."
"9949",1155,""
"9950",1155,"Mr. Carter sighed in his tired manner."
"9951",1155,""
"9952",1155,"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a telephone"
"9953",1155,"message to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer"
"9954",1155,"office?"
"9955",1155,""
"9956",1155,"Tuppence thought."
"9957",1155,""
"9958",1155,"No, I dont think I did."
"9959",1155,""
"9960",1155,"Exactly. That message was Mr. Browns way of giving an order to his"
"9961",1155,"subordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of course. Was it after"
"9962",1155,"that that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come"
"9963",1155,"the following day?"
"9964",1155,""
"9965",1155,"Tuppence nodded."
"9966",1155,""
"9967",1155,"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown! Mr. Carter paused. Well,"
"9968",1155,"there it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against? Possibly"
"9969",1155,"the finest criminal brain of the age. I dont quite like it, you know."
"9970",1155,"Youre such young things, both of you. I shouldnt like anything to"
"9971",1155,"happen to you."
"9972",1155,""
"9973",1155,"It wont, Tuppence assured him positively."
"9974",1155,""
"9975",1155,"Ill look after her, sir, said Tommy."
"9976",1155,""
"9977",1155,"And _I_ll look after _you_, retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly"
"9978",1155,"assertion."
"9979",1155,""
"9980",1155,"Well, then, look after each other, said Mr. Carter, smiling. Now"
"9981",1155,"lets get back to business. Theres something mysterious about this"
"9982",1155,"draft treaty that we havent fathomed yet. Weve been threatened with"
"9983",1155,"it--in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good"
"9984",1155,"as declare that its in their hands, and that they intend to produce it"
"9985",1155,"at a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about"
"9986",1155,"many of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff"
"9987",1155,"on their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of"
"9988",1155,"absolute denial. Im not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet"
"9989",1155,"allusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The"
"9990",1155,"position is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating"
"9991",1155,"document, but couldnt read it because it was in cipher--but we know"
"9992",1155,"that the draft treaty wasnt in cipher--couldnt be in the nature of"
"9993",1155,"things--so that wont wash. But theres _something_. Of course, Jane"
"9994",1155,"Finn may be dead for all we know--but I dont think so. The curious"
"9995",1155,"thing is that _theyre trying to get information about the girl from"
"9996",1155,"us_."
"9997",1155,""
"9998",1155,"What?"
"9999",1155,""
"10000",1155,"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story, little"
"10001",1155,"lady, confirms my idea. They know were looking for Jane Finn. Well,"
"10002",1155,"theyll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a _pensionnat_ in"
"10003",1155,"Paris. Tuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. No one knows in the"
"10004",1155,"least what she looks like, so thats all right. Shes primed with a"
"10005",1155,"trumped-up tale, and her real business is to get as much information as"
"10006",1155,"possible out of us. See the idea?"
"10007",1155,""
"10008",1155,"Then you think--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition fully--that"
"10009",1155,"it _was_ as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris?"
"10010",1155,""
"10011",1155,"Mr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever."

"10029",1155,"My word! I dont wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence"
"10030",1155,"plumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, were"
"10031",1155,"taking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before"
"10032",1155,"we clear out?"
"10033",1155,""
"10034",1155,"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed."

"10040",1155,""
"10041",1155,"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before"
"10042",1155,"them. I have information that the big _coup_ was planned for early in"
"10043",1155,"the new year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action"
"10044",1155,"which will deal effectually with the strike menace. Theyll get wind of"
"10045",1155,"it soon, if they havent already, and its possible that that may bring"
"10046",1155,"things to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to"
"10047",1155,"mature their plans the better. Im just warning you that you havent"
"10048",1155,"much time before you, and that you neednt be cast down if you fail."
"10049",1155,"Its not an easy proposition anyway. Thats all."

"10055",1155,"succinctly: Funds within reason, detailed information on any point,"
"10056",1155,"and _no official recognition_. I mean that if you get yourselves into"

"10613",1155,"WHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy started"
"10614",1155,"in pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the corner of the"
"10615",1155,"street. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by"
"10616",1155,"the time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them"
"10617",1155,"was sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively"
"10618",1155,"deserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in"
"10619",1155,"sight."
"10620",1155,""
"10621",1155,"The sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities"
"10622",1155,"from a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to"
"10623",1155,"follow anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual"
"10624",1155,"practice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for"
"10625",1155,"instance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply"
"10626",1155,"leapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern"
"10627",1155,"equivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it"
"10628",1155,"was extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he"
"10629",1155,"would have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran"
"10630",1155,"incessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road"
"10631",1155,"he might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a"
"10632",1155,"bus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that"
"10633",1155,"an officious policeman might stop him to explain matters."
"10634",1155,""
"10635",1155,"At this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the"

"10638",1155,"He drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged. Their"
"10639",1155,"course was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible"
"10640",1155,"to Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an"
"10641",1155,"easterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little"
"10642",1155,"he gained upon them. On the crowded pavement there was little chance of"
"10643",1155,"his attracting their notice, and he was anxious if possible to catch"
"10644",1155,"a word or two of their conversation. In this he was completely"
"10645",1155,"foiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices"
"10646",1155,"effectually."
"10647",1155,""
"10648",1155,"Just before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, Tommy,"
"10649",1155,"unperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons."
"10650",1155,"There they went up to the first floor, and sat at a small table in the"
"10651",1155,"window. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat"
"10652",1155,"at the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case"
"10653",1155,"of recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man"
"10654",1155,"and studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face,"
"10655",1155,"and Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was"
"10656",1155,"probably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he"
"10657",1155,"talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly."
"10658",1155,""
"10659",1155,"Having already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with ordering"
"10660",1155,"a Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington ordered a substantial"
"10661",1155,"lunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he"
"10662",1155,"moved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly"
"10663",1155,"in a low voice. The other man joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could"
"10664",1155,"only catch a word here and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some"
"10665",1155,"directions or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion,"
"10666",1155,"and with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree."
"10667",1155,"Whittington addressed the other as Boris."
"10668",1155,""
"10669",1155,"Tommy caught the word Ireland several times, also propaganda, but"
"10670",1155,"of Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of"
"10671",1155,"the room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. Ah, but"
"10672",1155,"you dont know Flossie. Shes a marvel. An archbishop would swear she"
"10673",1155,"was his own mother. She gets the voice right every time, and thats"

"10675",1155,""
"10676",1155,"Tommy did not hear Boriss reply, but in response to it Whittington said"
"10677",1155,"something that sounded like: Of course--only in an emergency...."

"10680",1155,"again whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices,"
"10681",1155,"or because Tommys ears were getting more attuned, he could not tell."
"10682",1155,"But two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener."

"10687",1155,"Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common. Did"
"10688",1155,"he not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet him--Mr."
"10689",1155,"Brown."
"10690",1155,""
"10691",1155,"There was a steely ring in Whittingtons voice as he replied:"

"10693",1155,"Who knows? You may have met him already."
"10694",1155,""
"10695",1155,"Bah! retorted the other. That is childrens talk--a fable for the"
"10696",1155,"police. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he is a fable"
"10697",1155,"invented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us with. It might be so."

"10702",1155,"unknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret well. And"
"10703",1155,"the idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look at each other--"
"10704",1155,"_one of us is Mr. Brown_--which? He commands--but also he serves. Among"

"10727",1155,"the booking-office. He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth,"
"10728",1155,"Tommy did the same. As he emerged, Boris remarked, glancing up at the"
"10729",1155,"clock: You are early. You have nearly half an hour."

"10731",1155,"Boriss words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommys mind."
"10732",1155,"Clearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other"
"10733",1155,"remained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he"
"10734",1155,"would follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of them unless----"
"10735",1155,"Like Boris, he glanced up at the clock, and then to the announcement"
"10736",1155,"board of the trains. The Bournemouth train left at 3.30. It was now ten"
"10737",1155,"past. Whittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall."
"10738",1155,"He gave one doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent"
"10739",1155,"telephone box. He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of"
"10740",1155,"Tuppence. In all probability she was still in the neighbourhood of South"
"10741",1155,"Audley Mansions. But there remained another ally. He rang up the _Ritz_"

"10749",1155,"then?"
"10750",1155,""

"10762",1155,"had not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum"
"10763",1155,"of money on him. The taking of the first-class ticket to Bournemouth"

"10802",1155,"From Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus. Then he"
"10803",1155,"walked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into the maze of mean"
"10804",1155,"streets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a judicious distance."
"10805",1155,""
"10806",1155,"They reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had"
"10807",1155,"a sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round,"
"10808",1155,"and Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was"
"10809",1155,"almost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed"
"10810",1155,"that way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommys"
"10811",1155,"imagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the"
"10812",1155,"steps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a"
"10813",1155,"peculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or"
"10814",1155,"two to the doorkeeper, then passed inside. The door was shut to again."
"10815",1155,""
"10816",1155,"It was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have"
"10817",1155,"done, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where"
"10818",1155,"he was and wait for his man to come out again. What he did do was"
"10819",1155,"entirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his"
"10820",1155,"leading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in"
"10821",1155,"his brain. Without a moments pause for reflection he, too, went up the"
"10822",1155,"steps, and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock."
"10823",1155,""
"10824",1155,"The door swung open with the same promptness as before. A"
"10825",1155,"villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway."
"10826",1155,""
"10827",1155,"Well? he grunted."
"10828",1155,""
"10829",1155,"It was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to"
"10830",1155,"come home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He seized at the first"
"10831",1155,"words that came into his mind."
"10832",1155,""
"10833",1155,"Mr. Brown? he said."
"10834",1155,""
"10835",1155,"To his surprise the man stood aside."
"10836",1155,""
"10837",1155,"Upstairs, he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, second door"
"10838",1155,"on your left."

"10842",1155,"CHAPTER VIII. THE ADVENTURES OF TOMMY"
"10843",1155,""
"10844",1155,"TAKEN aback though he was by the mans words, Tommy did not hesitate."
"10845",1155,"If audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped"
"10846",1155,"it would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and"
"10847",1155,"mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy"
"10848",1155,"beyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern now indistinguishable,"
"10849",1155,"hung in loose festoons from the wall. In every angle was a grey mass of"
"10850",1155,"cobweb."
"10851",1155,""
"10852",1155,"Tommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of the"
"10853",1155,"staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back room."
"10854",1155,"Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to the house and"
"10855",1155,"ask for Mr. Brown appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural"
"10856",1155,"proceeding."
"10857",1155,""
"10858",1155,"At the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move. In"
"10859",1155,"front of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on either side of"
"10860",1155,"it. From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices."
"10861",1155,"It was this room which he had been directed to enter. But what held"
"10862",1155,"his glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right,"
"10863",1155,"half concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the"
"10864",1155,"left-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view"
"10865",1155,"of the upper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a"
"10866",1155,"pinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet"
"10867",1155,"wide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual"
"10868",1155,"slow and steady way, deciding that the mention of Mr. Brown was not a"
"10869",1155,"request for an individual, but in all probability a password used by"
"10870",1155,"the gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he had"
"10871",1155,"aroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step."
"10872",1155,""
"10873",1155,"Suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage."
"10874",1155,"Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be"
"10875",1155,"sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any"
"10876",1155,"rate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know all"
"10877",1155,"the members of the gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs."
"10878",1155,"On the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far,"
"10879",1155,"but that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter"
"10880",1155,"that room was a colossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part"
"10881",1155,"indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and"
"10882",1155,"then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness."
"10883",1155,""
"10884",1155,"A repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy,"
"10885",1155,"his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew"
"10886",1155,"the curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from"
"10887",1155,"sight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which"
"10888",1155,"afforded him a good view. He would watch events, and any time he chose"
"10889",1155,"could, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of"
"10890",1155,"the new arrival."
"10891",1155,""
"10892",1155,"The man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was"
"10893",1155,"quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society."
"10894",1155,"The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the"
"10895",1155,"whole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that"
"10896",1155,"Scotland Yard would have recognized at a glance."
"10897",1155,""
"10898",1155,"The man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at"
"10899",1155,"the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock. A voice"
"10900",1155,"inside called out something, and the man opened the door and passed in,"
"10901",1155,"affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside. He thought there"
"10902",1155,"must be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up"
"10903",1155,"most of the space, but his attention was caught and held by a tall man"
"10904",1155,"with close-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard,"
"10905",1155,"who sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the"
"10906",1155,"new-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously"
"10907",1155,"precise enunciation, which attracted Tommys notice, he asked:"
"10908",1155,""
"10909",1155,"Your number, comrade?"
"10910",1155,""
"10911",1155,"Fourteen, govnor, replied the other hoarsely."
"10912",1155,""
"10913",1155,"Correct."
"10914",1155,""
"10915",1155,"The door shut again."
"10916",1155,""
"10917",1155,"If that isnt a Hun, Im a Dutchman! said Tommy to himself. And"
"10918",1155,"running the show darned systematically too--as they always do. Lucky I"
"10919",1155,"didnt roll in. Id have given the wrong number, and there would have"
"10920",1155,"been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, heres"
"10921",1155,"another knock."
"10922",1155,""
"10923",1155,"This visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last."
"10924",1155,"Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly Mr. Browns"
"10925",1155,"organization was a far-reaching concern. The common criminal, the"
"10926",1155,"well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and the efficient German"
"10927",1155,"master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange and sinister gathering! Who"
"10928",1155,"was this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of"
"10929",1155,"an unknown chain?"
"10930",1155,""
"10931",1155,"In this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal knock, the"
"10932",1155,"demand for a number, and the reply Correct."
"10933",1155,""
"10934",1155,"Two knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The first man"
"10935",1155,"was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet,"
"10936",1155,"intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the"
"10937",1155,"working classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man."
"10938",1155,""
"10939",1155,"Three minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,"
"10940",1155,"exquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again, was not"
"10941",1155,"unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to"
"10942",1155,"it."
"10943",1155,""
"10944",1155,"After his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that"
"10945",1155,"the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out"
"10946",1155,"from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to"
"10947",1155,"cover."
"10948",1155,""
"10949",1155,"This last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast"
"10950",1155,"of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence."
"10951",1155,""
"10952",1155,"He was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The"
"10953",1155,"angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise"
"10954",1155,"there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess,"
"10955",1155,"he turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through"
"10956",1155,"the curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was"
"10957",1155,"there and in spite of himself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than"
"10958",1155,"the majority of young Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the"
"10959",1155,"impression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The"
"10960",1155,"creature reminded him of a venomous snake."
"10961",1155,""
"10962",1155,"A moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer knocked"
"10963",1155,"on the door as all had done, but his reception was very different. The"
"10964",1155,"bearded man rose to his feet, and all the others followed suit. The"
"10965",1155,"German came forward and shook hands. His heels clicked together."
"10966",1155,""
"10967",1155,"We are honoured, he said. We are greatly honoured. I much feared that"
"10968",1155,"it would be impossible."
"10969",1155,""
"10970",1155,"The other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:"
"10971",1155,""
"10972",1155,"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear. But one"
"10973",1155,"meeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do nothing without--Mr."
"10974",1155,"Brown. He is here?"
"10975",1155,""
"10976",1155,"The change in the Germans voice was audible as he replied with slight"
"10977",1155,"hesitation:"
"10978",1155,""
"10979",1155,"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present"
"10980",1155,"in person. He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the"
"10981",1155,"sentence unfinished."
"10982",1155,""
"10983",1155,"A very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked round at a"
"10984",1155,"circle of uneasy faces."
"10985",1155,""
"10986",1155,"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and"
"10987",1155,"trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us"
"10988",1155,"now.... He looked round him again, and again that expression of fear"
"10989",1155,"swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully."
"10990",1155,""
"10991",1155,"The Russian tapped his cheek."
"10992",1155,""
"10993",1155,"So be it. Let us proceed."
"10994",1155,""
"10995",1155,"The German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the place he"
"10996",1155,"had been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian demurred, but"
"10997",1155,"the other insisted."
"10998",1155,""
"10999",1155,"It is the only possible place, he said, for--Number One. Perhaps"
"11000",1155,"Number Fourteen will shut the door?"
"11001",1155,""
"11002",1155,"In another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels,"
"11003",1155,"and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable"
"11004",1155,"murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had"
"11005",1155,"stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must"
"11006",1155,"hear more."
"11007",1155,""
"11008",1155,"There was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the"
"11009",1155,"doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or"
"11010",1155,"two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy"
"11011",1155,"bent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain,"
"11012",1155,"he walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by"
"11013",1155,"the closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack. To his intense"
"11014",1155,"annoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and"
"11015",1155,"there if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity"
"11016",1155,"still farther."
"11017",1155,""
"11018",1155,"He eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees"
"11019",1155,"so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing?"
"11020",1155,"He decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a"
"11021",1155,"fraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in"
"11022",1155,"his excessive care. A little more--a little more still--would it never"
"11023",1155,"be finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther."
"11024",1155,""
"11025",1155,"He stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed"
"11026",1155,"it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge. Tommy was annoyed."
"11027",1155,"If he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak."
"11028",1155,"He waited until the voices rose a little, then he tried again. Still"
"11029",1155,"nothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing"
"11030",1155,"stuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the"
"11031",1155,"door remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked"
"11032",1155,"or bolted on the inside."
"11033",1155,""
"11034",1155,"For a moment or two Tommys indignation got the better of him."
"11035",1155,""
"11036",1155,"Well, Im damned! he said. What a dirty trick!"
"11037",1155,""
"11038",1155,"As his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation. Clearly"
"11039",1155,"the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original"
"11040",1155,"position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside would be almost"
"11041",1155,"certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite pains, he reversed his"
"11042",1155,"former tactics. All went well, and with a sigh of relief the young man"
"11043",1155,"rose to his feet. There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that"
"11044",1155,"made him slow to admit defeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far"
"11045",1155,"from abandoning the conflict. He still intended to hear what was going"
"11046",1155,"on in the locked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for"
"11047",1155,"another."
"11048",1155,""
"11049",1155,"He looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the left was"
"11050",1155,"a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened for a moment"
"11051",1155,"or two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he slipped inside."
"11052",1155,""
"11053",1155,"The room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like"
"11054",1155,"everything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces, and"
"11055",1155,"the dirt was, if anything, more abundant."
"11056",1155,""
"11057",1155,"But what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a"
"11058",1155,"communicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the window."
"11059",1155,"Carefully closing the door into the passage behind him, he stepped"
"11060",1155,"across to the other and examined it closely. The bolt was shot across"
"11061",1155,"it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By"
"11062",1155,"gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without"
"11063",1155,"making too much noise. Then he repeated his former manuvres with the"
"11064",1155,"handle--this time with complete success. The door swung open--a crack,"
"11065",1155,"a mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a"
"11066",1155,"velvet _portire_ on the inside of this door which prevented him from"
"11067",1155,"seeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount"
"11068",1155,"of accuracy."
"11069",1155,""
"11070",1155,"The Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable:"
"11071",1155,""
"11072",1155,"Thats all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no"
"11073",1155,"results!"
"11074",1155,""
"11075",1155,"Another voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied:"
"11076",1155,""
"11077",1155,"Will you guarantee that there _are_ results?"
"11078",1155,""
"11079",1155,"In a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will guarantee you"
"11080",1155,"such a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake the British Empire to"
"11081",1155,"its foundations."
"11082",1155,""
"11083",1155,"There was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of Number"
"11084",1155,"One:"
"11085",1155,""
"11086",1155,"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that."
"11087",1155,""
"11088",1155,"Boris asked a question:"
"11089",1155,""
"11090",1155,"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?"
"11091",1155,""
"11092",1155,"I guess thatll be all right! said a new voice, with a transatlantic"
"11093",1155,"intonation, though Id like to point out, here and now, that things"
"11094",1155,"are getting a mite difficult. Theres not the sympathy there was, and"
"11095",1155,"a growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without"
"11096",1155,"interference from America."
"11097",1155,""
"11098",1155,"Tommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:"
"11099",1155,""
"11100",1155,"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the"
"11101",1155,"States?"
"11102",1155,""
"11103",1155,"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition, said the Sinn"
"11104",1155,"Feiner. The money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to our colleague"
"11105",1155,"here."
"11106",1155,""
"11107",1155,"Another voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,"
"11108",1155,"commanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him, said:"
"11109",1155,""
"11110",1155,"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!"
"11111",1155,""
"11112",1155,"That is settled, then, said the sibilant tones. Now, in the matter"
"11113",1155,"of the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the details"
"11114",1155,"satisfactorily, Boris?"
"11115",1155,""
"11116",1155,"I think so."
"11117",1155,""
"11118",1155,"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming if"
"11119",1155,"necessary."
"11120",1155,""
"11121",1155,"There was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke the"
"11122",1155,"silence:"
"11123",1155,""
"11124",1155,"I am directed by--Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of the reports"

"11129",1155,"For a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of papers"

"11139",1155,"That is rather soon."
"11140",1155,""
"11141",1155,"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and we"
"11142",1155,"cannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be entirely"

"11145",1155,"The Russian laughed softly, as though amused."
"11146",1155,""
"11147",1155,"Yes, yes, he said. That is true. They must have no inkling that we"
"11148",1155,"are using them for our own ends. They are honest men--and that is their"
"11149",1155,"value to us. It is curious--but you cannot make a revolution without"
"11150",1155,"honest men. The instinct of the populace is infallible. He paused, and"
"11151",1155,"then repeated, as though the phrase pleased him: Every revolution has"
"11152",1155,"had its honest men. They are soon disposed of afterwards."

"11165",1155,""
"11166",1155,"You will have the best legal talent to defend you, replied the"
"11167",1155,"German quietly. But in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the"

"11169",1155,""
"11170",1155,"Oh, I aint afraid, govnor. All for the good of the cause. The streets"
"11171",1155,"is going to run with blood, so they say. He spoke with a grim relish."

"11187",1155,"But what?"
"11188",1155,""
"11189",1155,"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do nothing. If"

"11192",1155,"Why should they not?"

"11194",1155,"As youve said, theyre honest. And, in spite of everything weve"

"11206",1155,"certain document in existence which assured success."
"11207",1155,""
"11208",1155,"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders, the result"
"11209",1155,"would be immediate. They would publish it broadcast throughout England,"
"11210",1155,"and declare for the revolution without a moments hesitation. The"
"11211",1155,"Government would be broken finally and completely."

"11231",1155,"A girl? The Russians voice rose contemptuously. And you have not"
"11232",1155,"made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk."

"11252",1155,"WHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all Tuppences"
"11253",1155,"self-command to refrain from accompanying him. However, she contained"
"11254",1155,"herself as best she might, consoled by the reflection that her reasoning"
"11255",1155,"had been justified by events. The two men had undoubtedly come from the"
"11256",1155,"second floor flat, and that one slender thread of the name Rita had"
"11257",1155,"set the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of"
"11258",1155,"Jane Finn."
"11259",1155,""
"11260",1155,"The question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the grass grow"
"11261",1155,"under her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and debarred from joining him"
"11262",1155,"in the chase, the girl felt at a loose end. She retraced her steps"
"11263",1155,"to the entrance hall of the mansions. It was now tenanted by a small"
"11264",1155,"lift-boy, who was polishing brass fittings, and whistling the latest air"
"11265",1155,"with a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy."
"11266",1155,""
"11267",1155,"He glanced round at Tuppences entry. There was a certain amount of the"
"11268",1155,"gamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably got on well"
"11269",1155,"with small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed. She"
"11270",1155,"reflected that an ally in the enemys camp, so to speak, was not to be"
"11271",1155,"despised."
"11272",1155,""
"11273",1155,"Well, William, she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved"

"11278",1155,"Albert, miss, he corrected."

"11280",1155,"Albert be it, said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round the hall."
"11281",1155,"The effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert should miss it. She"
"11282",1155,"leaned towards the boy and dropped her voice: I want a word with you,"
"11283",1155,"Albert."
"11284",1155,""
"11285",1155,"Albert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly."

"11287",1155,"Look! Do you know what this is? With a dramatic gesture she flung back"
"11288",1155,"the left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was"
"11289",1155,"extremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it--indeed,"
"11290",1155,"it would have been fatal for Tuppences plans, since the badge in"
"11291",1155,"question was the device of a local training corps originated by the"
"11292",1155,"archdeacon in the early days of the war. Its presence in Tuppences coat"
"11293",1155,"was due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a"
"11294",1155,"day or two before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner"
"11295",1155,"of a threepenny detective novel protruding from Alberts pocket, and the"
"11296",1155,"immediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good,"
"11297",1155,"and that the fish would rise to the bait."
"11298",1155,""
"11299",1155,"American Detective Force! she hissed."

"11314",1155,"Tuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs."

"11316",1155,"No. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!"

"11318",1155,"Alberts hand stole to his pocket."

"11338",1155,"Shes some peach, allowed Tuppence carelessly. Finds it useful in her"

"11409",1155,"the ground floor."
"11410",1155,""
"11411",1155,"With which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked briskly"

"11413",1155,""
"11414",1155,"But there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the _Ritz_"

"11423",1155,"that final purchase. Five minutes later she smiled contentedly at her"
"11424",1155,"reflection in the glass. With an actresss pencil she had slightly"
"11425",1155,"altered the line of her eyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with"
"11426",1155,"the new luxuriant growth of fair hair above, so changed her appearance"
"11427",1155,"that she felt confident that even if she came face to face with"
"11428",1155,"Whittington he would not recognize her. She would wear elevators in her"
"11429",1155,"shoes, and the cap and apron would be an even more valuable disguise."

"11436",1155,"Dinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommys"
"11437",1155,"non-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the girls mind was"
"11438",1155,"more easily explained. His hustling activities were not confined"
"11439",1155,"to London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully"
"11440",1155,"accepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the days work. It"
"11441",1155,"was quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for"
"11442",1155,"Constantinople at a moments notice if he fancied that a clue to his"
"11443",1155,"cousins disappearance was to be found there. The energetic young"
"11444",1155,"man had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men"
"11445",1155,"unbearable to them, and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned"
"11446",1155,"to know and dread the familiar Hullo! He had spent three hours in"
"11447",1155,"Paris hustling the Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with"
"11448",1155,"the idea, possibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true"
"11449",1155,"clue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland."

"11830",1155,"Money--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I believe you"
"11831",1155,"would sell your soul for money. I believe---- He paused, then in a"

"11956",1155,""
"11957",1155,"DRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her afternoon"
"11958",1155,"out. Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the"
"11959",1155,"stationers to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied"
"11960",1155,"on this point, she made her way to the _Ritz_. On inquiry she learnt"
"11961",1155,"that Tommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but"
"11962",1155,"it was another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal"
"11963",1155,"to Mr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his"
"11964",1155,"quest, and asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of"
"11965",1155,"his aid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius"
"11966",1155,"Hersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned"
"11967",1155,"about half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately."
"11968",1155,""
"11969",1155,"Tuppences spirits revived still more. It would be something to see"
"11970",1155,"Julius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what"
"11971",1155,"had become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Juliuss"
"11972",1155,"sitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst"
"11973",1155,"open."
"11974",1155,""
"11975",1155,"What the hell---- began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. I beg"
"11976",1155,"your pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the office would have it"
"11977",1155,"that Beresford wasnt here any longer--hadnt been here since Wednesday."
"11978",1155,"Is that so?"
"11979",1155,""

"11984",1155,"I? How should I know? I havent had one darned word from him, though I"
"11985",1155,"wired him yesterday morning."

"11987",1155,"I expect your wires at the office unopened."

"11996",1155,"What depot?"
"11997",1155,""
"11998",1155,"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road."
"11999",1155,""
"12000",1155,"Waterloo? frowned Tuppence."

"12002",1155,"Why, yes. Didnt he tell you?"
"12003",1155,""
"12004",1155,"I havent seen him either, replied Tuppence impatiently. Go on about"
"12005",1155,"Waterloo. What were you doing there?"
"12006",1155,""
"12007",1155,"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and"
"12008",1155,"hustle. Said he was trailing two crooks."

"12010",1155,"Oh! said Tuppence, her eyes opening. I see. Go on."
"12011",1155,""
"12012",1155,"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the"
"12013",1155,"crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy shoved a ticket"
"12014",1155,"into my hand and told me to get aboard the cars. He was going to sleuth"
"12015",1155,"the other crook. Julius paused. I thought for sure youd know all"
"12016",1155,"this."
"12017",1155,""
"12018",1155,"Julius, said Tuppence firmly, stop walking up and down. It makes me"
"12019",1155,"giddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole story with as"
"12020",1155,"few fancy turns of speech as possible."
"12021",1155,""
"12022",1155,"Mr. Hersheimmer obeyed."
"12023",1155,""
"12024",1155,"Sure, he said. Where shall I begin?"
"12025",1155,""
"12026",1155,"Where you left off. At Waterloo."
"12027",1155,""
"12028",1155,"Well, began Julius, I got into one of your dear old-fashioned"
"12029",1155,"first-class British compartments. The train was just off. First thing I"
"12030",1155,"knew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasnt"
"12031",1155,"in a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled"
"12032",1155,"that. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach."
"12033",1155,"Whittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big"
"12034",1155,"sleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt"
"12035",1155,"real mad that I hadnt got a gun with me. Id have tickled him up some."
"12036",1155,""
"12037",1155,"We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the"
"12038",1155,"name of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes"
"12039",1155,"of each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too. So far it was all"
"12040",1155,"plain sailing. He hadnt the remotest notion that anyone was on to him."
"12041",1155,"Well, he just sat around in the hotel lounge, reading the papers and so"
"12042",1155,"on, till it was time for dinner. He didnt hurry any over that either."
"12043",1155,""
"12044",1155,"I began to think that there was nothing doing, that hed just come on"
"12045",1155,"the trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadnt changed for"
"12046",1155,"dinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up hotel, so it seemed"
"12047",1155,"likely enough that hed be going out on his real business afterwards."
"12048",1155,""
"12049",1155,"Sure enough, about nine oclock, so he did. Took a car across the"
"12050",1155,"town--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess Ill take Jane there for"
"12051",1155,"a spell when I find her--and then paid it off and struck out along those"
"12052",1155,"pine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was there too, you understand."
"12053",1155,"We walked, maybe, for half an hour. Theres a lot of villas all the way"
"12054",1155,"along, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and"
"12055",1155,"in the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it"
"12056",1155,"was, with a lot of piny grounds around it."
"12057",1155,""
"12058",1155,"It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the house was"
"12059",1155,"dark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I couldnt see him. I"
"12060",1155,"had to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being"
"12061",1155,"followed. I turned a curve and I was just in time to see him ring the"
"12062",1155,"bell and get admitted to the house. I just stopped where I was. It was"
"12063",1155,"beginning to rain, and I was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it"
"12064",1155,"was almighty cold."
"12065",1155,""
"12066",1155,"Whittington didnt come out again, and by and by I got kind of restive,"
"12067",1155,"and began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows were shuttered"
"12068",1155,"tight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a two-storied house) I"
"12069",1155,"noticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn."
"12070",1155,""
"12071",1155,"Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It was"
"12072",1155,"about thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into"
"12073",1155,"my head that, if I climbed up that tree, Id very likely be able to see"
"12074",1155,"into that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington"
"12075",1155,"should be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact,"
"12076",1155,"for the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms"
"12077",1155,"downstairs. But I guess Id got the hump from standing so long in the"
"12078",1155,"rain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I"
"12079",1155,"started up."
"12080",1155,""
"12081",1155,"It wasnt so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty"
"12082",1155,"slippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I"
"12083",1155,"managed it, until at last there I was level with the window."
"12084",1155,""
"12085",1155,"But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could only"
"12086",1155,"see sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper"
"12087",1155,"was all I could command. Well, that wasnt any manner of good to me, but"
"12088",1155,"just as I was going to give it up, and climb down ignominiously, some"
"12089",1155,"one inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall--and, by"
"12090",1155,"gum, it was Whittington!"
"12091",1155,""
"12092",1155,"After that, my blood was up. Id just _got_ to get a look into that"
"12093",1155,"room. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that there was a long"
"12094",1155,"branch running out from the tree in the right direction. If I could only"
"12095",1155,"swarm about half-way along it, the proposition would be solved. But it"
"12096",1155,"was mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight. I decided Id"
"12097",1155,"just got to risk that, and I started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I"
"12098",1155,"crawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it"
"12099",1155,"didnt do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where"
"12100",1155,"I wanted to be."
"12101",1155,""
"12102",1155,"The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way."
"12103",1155,"There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and"
"12104",1155,"sitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough."
"12105",1155,"He was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting"
"12106",1155,"with her back to me, so I couldnt see her face. Although the blinds"
"12107",1155,"were up, the window itself was shut, so I couldnt catch a word of what"
"12108",1155,"they said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse"
"12109",1155,"just listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes shed shake"
"12110",1155,"her head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very"
"12111",1155,"emphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The rain had"
"12112",1155,"stopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does."
"12113",1155,""
"12114",1155,"Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying. He got"
"12115",1155,"up, and so did she. He looked towards the window and asked something--I"
"12116",1155,"guess it was whether it was raining. Anyway, she came right across and"
"12117",1155,"looked out. Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds. I"
"12118",1155,"was scared the woman would catch sight of me, for I was full in the"
"12119",1155,"moonlight. I tried to move back a bit. The jerk I gave was too much for"
"12120",1155,"that rotten old branch. With an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius"
"12121",1155,"P. Hersheimmer with it!"
"12122",1155,""
"12123",1155,"Oh, Julius, breathed Tuppence, how exciting! Go on."
"12124",1155,""
"12125",1155,"Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of earth--but"
"12126",1155,"it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The next thing I"
"12127",1155,"knew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not Whittingtons one)"
"12128",1155,"on one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses,"
"12129",1155,"and medical man written all over him, on the other. He rubbed his hands"
"12130",1155,"together, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. Ah! he said. So"
"12131",1155,"our young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital."
"12132",1155,""
"12133",1155,"I did the usual stunt. Said: Whats happened? And Where am I? But"
"12134",1155,"I knew the answer to the last well enough. Theres no moss growing on"
"12135",1155,"my brain. I think thatll do for the present, sister, said the little"
"12136",1155,"man, and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way."
"12137",1155,"But I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed"
"12138",1155,"through the door."
"12139",1155,""
"12140",1155,"That look of hers gave me an idea. Now then, doc, I said, and tried"
"12141",1155,"to sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so."
"12142",1155,"A slight sprain, explained the doctor. Nothing serious. Youll be"
"12143",1155,"about again in a couple of days."

"12148",1155,""
"12149",1155,"How did it happen? I asked again. He replied dryly. You fell, with"
"12150",1155,"a considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of my newly planted"
"12151",1155,"flower-beds."
"12152",1155,""
"12153",1155,"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt sure that"
"12154",1155,"he, at least, was plumb straight. Sure, doc, I said, Im sorry about"
"12155",1155,"the tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps youd"
"12156",1155,"like to know what I was doing in your garden? I think the facts do"
"12157",1155,"call for an explanation, he replied. Well, to begin with, I wasnt"
"12158",1155,"after the spoons."
"12159",1155,""
"12160",1155,"He smiled. My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way,"
"12161",1155,"you are an American, are you not? I told him my name. And you? I am"
"12162",1155,"Dr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home."
"12163",1155,""
"12164",1155,"I didnt know, but I wasnt going to put him wise. I was just thankful"
"12165",1155,"for the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but"
"12166",1155,"I wasnt going to give him the whole story. For one thing he probably"
"12167",1155,"wouldnt have believed it."
"12168",1155,""
"12169",1155,"I made up my mind in a flash. Why, doctor, I said, I guess I feel"
"12170",1155,"an almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasnt"
"12171",1155,"the Bill Sikes business I was up to. Then I went on and mumbled out"
"12172",1155,"something about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a"
"12173",1155,"nervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized"
"12174",1155,"her among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I"
"12175",1155,"guess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. Quite a romance,"
"12176",1155,"he said genially, when Id finished. Now, doc, I went on, will you"
"12177",1155,"be frank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any time,"
"12178",1155,"a young girl called Jane Finn? He repeated the name thoughtfully. Jane"
"12179",1155,"Finn? he said. No."
"12180",1155,""
"12181",1155,"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. You are sure? Quite sure,"
"12182",1155,"Mr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I should not have been"
"12183",1155,"likely to forget it."
"12184",1155,""
"12185",1155,"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. Id kind of hoped"
"12186",1155,"my search was at an end. Thats that, I said at last. Now, theres"
"12187",1155,"another matter. When I was hugging that darned branch I thought I"
"12188",1155,"recognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses. I"
"12189",1155,"purposely didnt mention any name because, of course, Whittington might"
"12190",1155,"be calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor"
"12191",1155,"answered at once. Mr. Whittington, perhaps? Thats the fellow, I"
"12192",1155,"replied. Whats he doing down here? Dont tell me _his_ nerves are out"
"12193",1155,"of order?"
"12194",1155,""
"12195",1155,"Dr. Hall laughed. No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse"
"12196",1155,"Edith, who is a niece of his. Why, fancy that! I exclaimed. Is he"
"12197",1155,"still here? No, he went back to town almost immediately. What a"
"12198",1155,"pity! I ejaculated. But perhaps I could speak to his niece--Nurse"
"12199",1155,"Edith, did you say her name was?"
"12200",1155,""
"12201",1155,"But the doctor shook his head. Im afraid that, too, is impossible."
"12202",1155,"Nurse Edith left with a patient to-night also. I seem to be real"
"12203",1155,"unlucky, I remarked. Have you Mr. Whittingtons address in town?"
"12204",1155,"I guess Id like to look him up when I get back. I dont know his"
"12205",1155,"address. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like. I thanked him."
"12206",1155,"Dont say who it is wants it. Id like to give him a little surprise."
"12207",1155,""
"12208",1155,"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl"
"12209",1155,"was really Whittingtons niece, she might be too cute to fall into the"
"12210",1155,"trap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire"
"12211",1155,"to Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained"
"12212",1155,"foot, and telling him to come down if he wasnt busy. I had to be"
"12213",1155,"guarded in what I said. However, I didnt hear from him, and my foot"
"12214",1155,"soon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I"
"12215",1155,"said good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if"
"12216",1155,"he heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss"
"12217",1155,"Tuppence, youre looking mighty pale!"

"12221",1155,"Buck up, I guess hes all right really. Why shouldnt he be? See here,"
"12222",1155,"it was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe theyve gone"
"12223",1155,"abroad--to Poland, or something like that?"

"12225",1155,"Tuppence shook her head."

"12227",1155,"He couldnt without passports and things. Besides Ive seen that man,"
"12228",1155,"Boris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer last night."

"12230",1155,"Mrs. Who?"

"12232",1155,"I forgot. Of course you dont know all that."
"12233",1155,""
"12234",1155,"Im listening, said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite expression."
"12235",1155,"Put me wise."
"12236",1155,""
"12237",1155,"Tuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days. Juliuss"
"12238",1155,"astonishment and admiration were unbounded."
"12239",1155,""
"12240",1155,"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death! Then"
"12241",1155,"he added seriously: But say now, I dont like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure"
"12242",1155,"dont. Youre just as plucky as they make em, but I wish youd keep"
"12243",1155,"right out of this. These crooks were up against would as soon croak a"

"12249",1155,"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesnt alter facts."
"12250",1155,""
"12251",1155,"Oh, bother _me!_ said Tuppence impatiently. Lets think about what"
"12252",1155,"can have happened to Tommy. Ive written to Mr. Carter about it, she"
"12253",1155,"added, and told him the gist of her letter."

"12260",1155,"What can we do? asked Tuppence, her spirits rising."
"12261",1155,""
"12262",1155,"I guess wed better get on the track of Boris. You say hes been to"
"12263",1155,"your place. Is he likely to come again?"

"12265",1155,"He might. I really dont know."

"12267",1155,"I see. Well, I guess Id better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a"
"12268",1155,"chauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you could make"
"12269",1155,"some kind of signal, and Id trail him. Hows that?"
"12270",1155,""
"12271",1155,"Splendid, but he mightnt come for weeks."
"12272",1155,""

"12313",1155,""

"12326",1155,""
"12327",1155,"Thirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took Tuppence"
"12328",1155,"by the arm, and walked her to the window."

"12332",1155,"Oh! said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she gazed"

"12341",1155,"Well?"

"12343",1155,"I went round to his house, said Julius. I said that I reckoned a car"

"12345",1155,"him that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if hed"
"12346",1155,"get out."

"12354",1155,"CHAPTER XII. A FRIEND IN NEED"
"12355",1155,""
"12356",1155,"FRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a brief"
"12357",1155,"answer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out that the"
"12358",1155,"Young Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk, and had"
"12359",1155,"been fully warned of the dangers. If anything had happened to Tommy he"
"12360",1155,"regretted it deeply, but he could do nothing."
"12361",1155,""
"12362",1155,"This was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out"
"12363",1155,"of the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of"
"12364",1155,"success. While they had been together she had never questioned it for"
"12365",1155,"a minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride"
"12366",1155,"herself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy"
"12367",1155,"more than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently"
"12368",1155,"sober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of"
"12369",1155,"vision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a"
"12370",1155,"rudderless ship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much"
"12371",1155,"cleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She"
"12372",1155,"had accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he"
"12373",1155,"always saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was"
"12374",1155,"optimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really"
"12375",1155,"relied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very"
"12376",1155,"sure."
"12377",1155,""
"12378",1155,"It seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the"
"12379",1155,"sinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly."
"12380",1155,"It had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it"
"12381",1155,"seemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy--that was all that mattered."
"12382",1155,"Many times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes"
"12383",1155,"resolutely. Little fool, she would apostrophize herself, dont"
"12384",1155,"snivel. Of course youre fond of him. Youve known him all your life."
"12385",1155,"But theres no need to be sentimental about it."
"12386",1155,""
"12387",1155,"In the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the"
"12388",1155,"flat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over"
"12389",1155,"to new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Juliuss objections,"
"12390",1155,"she had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to"
"12391",1155,"Sir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his"
"12392",1155,"address in the _Red Book_. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so,"
"12393",1155,"why? Surely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had"
"12394",1155,"looked at her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning"
"12395",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommys whereabouts."
"12396",1155,""
"12397",1155,"Anyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was"
"12398",1155,"worth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She"
"12399",1155,"would meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would"
"12400",1155,"beard the lion in his den."
"12401",1155,""
"12402",1155,"When the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading,"
"12403",1155,"but Tuppence held firm. It can do no harm, was what she always came"
"12404",1155,"back to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to"
"12405",1155,"Carlton House Terrace."
"12406",1155,""
"12407",1155,"The door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little"

"12409",1155,"had decided not to ask if Sir James was at home, but to adopt a more"
"12410",1155,"personal attitude."
"12411",1155,""
"12412",1155,"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an"

"12418",1155,""
"12419",1155,"He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a"
"12420",1155,"library. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence"
"12421",1155,"noticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology."
"12422",1155,"There were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned"
"12423",1155,"open hearth. In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at"

"12432",1155,"Not exactly, said Tuppence. In fact, Im afraid I only said that to"

"12439",1155,""
"12440",1155,"Sir James, said Tuppence, plunging boldly, I dare say you will think"
"12441",1155,"it is most awful cheek of me coming here like this. Because, of course,"
"12442",1155,"its nothing whatever to do with you, and then youre a very important"
"12443",1155,"person, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant. She paused for"

"12456",1155,"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasnt it?"
"12457",1155,""
"12458",1155,"Well, perhaps it was, admitted Sir James gravely."
"12459",1155,""
"12460",1155,"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just _why_ you gave me a"
"12461",1155,"hint."
"12462",1155,""
"12463",1155,"Sir James smiled at her earnestness."
"12464",1155,""
"12465",1155,"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of"
"12466",1155,"character?"
"12467",1155,""
"12468",1155,"Of course, said Tuppence. I know lawyers are always dreadfully"
"12469",1155,"careful. But cant we say without prejudice first, and then say just"
"12470",1155,"what we want to."
"12471",1155,""
"12472",1155,"Well, said Sir James, still smiling, without prejudice, then, if I"
"12473",1155,"had a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not like to see"
"12474",1155,"her in Mrs. Vandemeyers service. I felt it incumbent on me just to give"
"12475",1155,"you a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is"
"12476",1155,"all I can tell you."
"12477",1155,""
"12478",1155,"I see, said Tuppence thoughtfully. Thank you very much. But Im not"
"12479",1155,"_really_ inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that she was a bad"
"12480",1155,"lot when I went there--as a matter of fact thats _why_ I went---- She"
"12481",1155,"broke off, seeing some bewilderment on the lawyers face, and went on:"
"12482",1155,"I think perhaps Id better tell you the whole story, Sir James. Ive a"
"12483",1155,"sort of feeling that youd know in a minute if I didnt tell the truth,"
"12484",1155,"and so you might as well know all about it from the beginning. What do"
"12485",1155,"you think, Julius?"
"12486",1155,""
"12487",1155,"As youre bent on it, Id go right ahead with the facts, replied the"
"12488",1155,"American, who had so far sat in silence."
"12489",1155,""
"12490",1155,"Yes, tell me all about it, said Sir James. I want to know who Tommy"
"12491",1155,"is."
"12492",1155,""
"12493",1155,"Thus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer listened"
"12494",1155,"with close attention."
"12495",1155,""
"12496",1155,"Very interesting, he said, when she finished. A great deal of what"
"12497",1155,"you tell me, child, is already known to me. Ive had certain theories"
"12498",1155,"of my own about this Jane Finn. Youve done extraordinarily well so"
"12499",1155,"far, but its rather too bad of--what do you know him as?--Mr. Carter to"
"12500",1155,"pitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind. By the"
"12501",1155,"way, where did Mr. Hersheimmer come in originally? You didnt make that"
"12502",1155,"clear?"
"12503",1155,""
"12504",1155,"Julius answered for himself."
"12505",1155,""
"12506",1155,"Im Janes first cousin, he explained, returning the lawyers keen"
"12507",1155,"gaze."
"12508",1155,""
"12509",1155,"Ah!"
"12510",1155,""
"12511",1155,"Oh, Sir James, broke out Tuppence, what do you think has become of"
"12512",1155,"Tommy?"
"12513",1155,""
"12514",1155,"Hm. The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. When you arrived,"
"12515",1155,"young lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to Scotland by the"
"12516",1155,"night train for a few days fishing. But there are different kinds of"
"12517",1155,"fishing. Ive a good mind to stay, and see if we cant get on the track"
"12518",1155,"of that young chap."
"12519",1155,""
"12520",1155,"Oh! Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically."
"12521",1155,""
"12522",1155,"All the same, as I said before, its too bad of--of Carter to set you"
"12523",1155,"two babies on a job like this. Now, dont get offended, Miss--er----"
"12524",1155,""
"12525",1155,"Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence."
"12526",1155,""
"12527",1155,"Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as Im certainly going to be a friend. Dont"
"12528",1155,"be offended because I think youre young. Youth is a failing only too"
"12529",1155,"easily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy of yours----"
"12530",1155,""
"12531",1155,"Yes. Tuppence clasped her hands."
"12532",1155,""
"12533",1155,"Frankly, things look bad for him. Hes been butting in somewhere where"
"12534",1155,"he wasnt wanted. Not a doubt of it. But dont give up hope."
"12535",1155,""
"12536",1155,"And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didnt want me to come,"
"12537",1155," she added by way of explanation."
"12538",1155,""
"12539",1155,"Hm, said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen glance. And"
"12540",1155,"why was that?"
"12541",1155,""
"12542",1155,"I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little"
"12543",1155,"business like this."
"12544",1155,""
"12545",1155,"I see. He paused a moment. This petty little business, as you call"
"12546",1155,"it, bears directly on a very big business, bigger perhaps than either"
"12547",1155,"you or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is alive, he may have very"
"12548",1155,"valuable information to give us. Therefore, we must find him."
"12549",1155,""
"12550",1155,"Yes, but how? cried Tuppence. Ive tried to think of everything."
"12551",1155,""
"12552",1155,"Sir James smiled."
"12553",1155,""
"12554",1155,"And yet theres one person quite near at hand who in all probability"
"12555",1155,"knows where he is, or at all events where he is likely to be."
"12556",1155,""
"12557",1155,"Who is that? asked Tuppence, puzzled."
"12558",1155,""
"12559",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer."
"12560",1155,""
"12561",1155,"Yes, but shed never tell us."
"12562",1155,""
"12563",1155,"Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I shall be"
"12564",1155,"able to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know."
"12565",1155,""
"12566",1155,"How? demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide."
"12567",1155,""
"12568",1155,"Oh, just by asking her questions, replied Sir James easily. Thats"
"12569",1155,"the way we do it, you know."
"12570",1155,""
"12571",1155,"He tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again the"
"12572",1155,"intense power that radiated from the man."
"12573",1155,""
"12574",1155,"And if she wont tell? asked Julius suddenly."
"12575",1155,""
"12576",1155,"I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in that"
"12577",1155,"unlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery."
"12578",1155,""
"12579",1155,"Sure. And thats where I come in! cried Julius, bringing his fist down"
"12580",1155,"on the table with a bang. You can count on me, if necessary, for one"
"12581",1155,"million dollars. Yes, sir, one million dollars!"
"12582",1155,""
"12583",1155,"Sir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny."
"12584",1155,""
"12585",1155,"Mr. Hersheimmer, he said at last, that is a very large sum."
"12586",1155,""
"12587",1155,"I guess itll have to be. These arent the kind of folk to offer"
"12588",1155,"sixpence to."
"12589",1155,""
"12590",1155,"At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two"
"12591",1155,"hundred and fifty thousand pounds."
"12592",1155,""
"12593",1155,"Thats so. Maybe you think Im talking through my hat, but I can"
"12594",1155,"deliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for your fee."
"12595",1155,""
"12596",1155,"Sir James flushed slightly."
"12597",1155,""
"12598",1155,"There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private"
"12599",1155,"detective."
"12600",1155,""
"12601",1155,"Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but Ive been feeling bad about"
"12602",1155,"this money question. I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane"
"12603",1155,"some days ago, but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me"
"12604",1155,"against it. Said it was undesirable."
"12605",1155,""
"12606",1155,"They were probably right, said Sir James dryly."
"12607",1155,""
"12608",1155,"But its all O.K. about Julius, put in Tuppence. Hes not pulling"
"12609",1155,"your leg. Hes got simply pots of money."
"12610",1155,""
"12611",1155,"The old man piled it up in style, explained Julius. Now, lets get"
"12612",1155,"down to it. Whats your idea?"
"12613",1155,""
"12614",1155,"Sir James considered for a moment or two."
"12615",1155,""
"12616",1155,"There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better. He"
"12617",1155,"turned to Tuppence. Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night, do you"
"12618",1155,"know?"
"12619",1155,""
"12620",1155,"Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she would"
"12621",1155,"have taken the latchkey."
"12622",1155,""
"12623",1155,"Good. I will call upon her about ten oclock. What time are you"
"12624",1155,"supposed to return?"
"12625",1155,""
"12626",1155,"About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier."
"12627",1155,""
"12628",1155,"You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion if you"
"12629",1155,"did not stay out till the usual time. Be back by nine-thirty. I will"
"12630",1155,"arrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps."
"12631",1155,""
"12632",1155,"Hes got a new Rolls-Royce car, said Tuppence with vicarious pride."
"12633",1155,""
"12634",1155,"Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we can"
"12635",1155,"go there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if necessary. You"
"12636",1155,"understand?"
"12637",1155,""
"12638",1155,"Yes. Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. Oh, I feel so"
"12639",1155,"much better!"
"12640",1155,""
"12641",1155,"Dont build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy."
"12642",1155,""
"12643",1155,"Julius turned to the lawyer."
"12644",1155,""
"12645",1155,"Say, then. Ill call for you in the car round about nine-thirty. Is"
"12646",1155,"that right?"
"12647",1155,""
"12648",1155,"Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to have two"
"12649",1155,"cars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to you is to go and"
"12650",1155,"have a good dinner, a _really_ good one, mind. And dont think ahead"
"12651",1155,"more than you can help."
"12652",1155,""
"12653",1155,"He shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were outside."
"12654",1155,""
"12655",1155,"Isnt he a duck? inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped down"
"12656",1155,"the steps. Oh, Julius, isnt he just a duck?"
"12657",1155,""
"12658",1155,"Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about"
"12659",1155,"its being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the"
"12660",1155,"_Ritz?_"
"12661",1155,""
"12662",1155,"I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the park,"
"12663",1155,"will you? Unless youd like to come too?"
"12664",1155,""
"12665",1155,"I want to get some petrol, he explained. And send off a cable or"
"12666",1155,"two."
"12667",1155,""
"12668",1155,"All right. Ill meet you at the _Ritz_ at seven. Well have to dine"
"12669",1155,"upstairs. I cant show myself in these glad rags."
"12670",1155,""
"12671",1155,"Sure. Ill get Felix help me choose the menu. Hes some head waiter,"
"12672",1155,"that. So long."
"12673",1155,""
"12674",1155,"Tuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first glancing at"
"12675",1155,"her watch. It was nearly six oclock. She remembered that she had had no"
"12676",1155,"tea, but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger. She walked as"
"12677",1155,"far as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps, feeling"
"12678",1155,"infinitely better for the fresh air and exercise. It was not so easy to"
"12679",1155,"follow Sir Jamess advice, and put the possible events of the evening"
"12680",1155,"out of her head. As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the"
"12681",1155,"temptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible."
"12682",1155,""
"12683",1155,"At any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and _look_"
"12684",1155,"at the building. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting"
"12685",1155,"patiently for ten oclock."
"12686",1155,""
"12687",1155,"South Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence"
"12688",1155,"had expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity"
"12689",1155,"slightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness"
"12690",1155,"that possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing"
"12691",1155,"whistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join"
"12692",1155,"her."
"12693",1155,""
"12694",1155,"Tuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have attention"
"12695",1155,"called to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with"
"12696",1155,"suppressed excitement."
"12697",1155,""
"12698",1155,"I say, miss, shes a-going!"
"12699",1155,""
"12700",1155,"Whos going? demanded Tuppence sharply."
"12701",1155,""
"12702",1155,"The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. Shes a-packing up, and shes"
"12703",1155,"just sent down word for me to get her a taxi."
"12704",1155,""
"12705",1155,"What? Tuppence clutched his arm."
"12706",1155,""
"12707",1155,"Its the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didnt know about it."
"12708",1155,""
"12709",1155,"Albert, cried Tuppence, youre a brick. If it hadnt been for you"
"12710",1155,"wed have lost her."
"12711",1155,""
"12712",1155,"Albert flushed with pleasure at this tribute."
"12713",1155,""
"12714",1155,"Theres no time to lose, said Tuppence, crossing the road. Ive got"
"12715",1155,"to stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until---- She broke off."
"12716",1155,"Albert, theres a telephone here, isnt there?"
"12717",1155,""
"12718",1155,"The boy shook his head."
"12719",1155,""
"12720",1155,"The flats mostly have their own, miss. But theres a box just round the"
"12721",1155,"corner."
"12722",1155,""
"12723",1155,"Go to it then, at once, and ring up the _Ritz Hotel_. Ask for Mr."
"12724",1155,"Hersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on"
"12725",1155,"at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you cant get him,"
"12726",1155,"ring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, youll find his number in the book, and"
"12727",1155,"tell him whats happening. You wont forget the names, will you?"
"12728",1155,""
"12729",1155,"Albert repeated them glibly. You trust to me, miss, itll be all right."
"12730",1155,"But what about you? Arent you afraid to trust yourself with her?"
"12731",1155,""
"12732",1155,"No, no, thats all right. _But go and telephone_. Be quick."
"12733",1155,""
"12734",1155,"Drawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the"
"12735",1155,"door of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men"
"12736",1155,"arrived, she did not know, but somehow or other it had to be done, and"
"12737",1155,"she must accomplish the task single-handed. What had occasioned this"
"12738",1155,"precipitate departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?"
"12739",1155,""
"12740",1155,"Speculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She might"
"12741",1155,"learn something from the cook."
"12742",1155,""
"12743",1155,"Nothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence pressed the"
"12744",1155,"bell again, keeping her finger on the button for some little while."
"12745",1155,"At last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer"
"12746",1155,"herself opened the door. She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the"
"12747",1155,"girl."
"12748",1155,""
"12749",1155,"You?"
"12750",1155,""
"12751",1155,"I had a touch of toothache, maam, said Tuppence glibly. So thought"
"12752",1155,"it better to come home and have a quiet evening."
"12753",1155,""
"12754",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence pass"
"12755",1155,"into the hall."
"12756",1155,""
"12757",1155,"How unfortunate for you, she said coldly. You had better go to bed."
"12758",1155,""
"12759",1155,"Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, maam. Cook will----"
"12760",1155,""
"12761",1155,"Cook is out, said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable tone. I"
"12762",1155,"sent her out. So you see you had better go to bed."
"12763",1155,""
"12764",1155,"Suddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyers"
"12765",1155,"voice that she did not like at all. Also, the other woman was slowly"
"12766",1155,"edging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at bay."
"12767",1155,""
"12768",1155,"I dont want----"
"12769",1155,""
"12770",1155,"Then, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and Mrs."
"12771",1155,"Vandemeyers voice rose cold and menacing:"
"12772",1155,""
"12773",1155,"You damned little fool! Do you think I dont know? No, dont answer. If"
"12774",1155,"you struggle or cry out, Ill shoot you like a dog."
"12775",1155,""
"12776",1155,"The rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girls temple."
"12777",1155,""
"12778",1155,"Now then, march, went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. This way--into my room. In"
"12779",1155,"a minute, when Ive done with you, youll go to bed as I told you to."
"12780",1155,"And youll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, youll sleep all right!"
"12781",1155,""
"12782",1155,"There was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which Tuppence"
"12783",1155,"did not at all like. For the moment there was nothing to be done, and"
"12784",1155,"she walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyers bedroom. The pistol never"
"12785",1155,"left her forehead. The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes"
"12786",1155,"were flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed,"
"12787",1155,"stood in the middle of the floor."
"12788",1155,""

"13139",1155,"lips. Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly. Tuppence held the glass"
"13140",1155,"to her lips."
"13141",1155,""
"13142",1155,"Drink this."
"13143",1155,""
"13144",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her"
"13145",1155,"white cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit"
"13146",1155,"up--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her side."
"13147",1155,""
"13148",1155,"Its my heart, she whispered. I mustnt talk."
"13149",1155,""

"13156",1155,""
"13157",1155,"All three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One"
"13158",1155,"and all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax. Clearly any"
"13159",1155,"scheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the"
"13160",1155,"moment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing."

"13162",1155,"Tuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing"
"13163",1155,"to disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to"
"13164",1155,"discover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was"
"13165",1155,"congratulatory."
"13166",1155,""
"13167",1155,"Thats all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred"
"13168",1155,"thousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it"

"13171",1155,""
"13172",1155,"There was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence"

"13174",1155,""
"13175",1155,"What you say is true, said Sir James meditatively. I must confess,"
"13176",1155,"however, that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute"
"13177",1155,"we did. Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until"

"13195",1155,""
"13196",1155,"What? Real plumb scared of him?"
"13197",1155,""
"13198",1155,"Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears."

"13203",1155,"flat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyers sake."

"13209",1155,""
"13210",1155,"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone, said Sir James dryly."
"13211",1155,"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due"
"13212",1155,"care, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our"
"13213",1155,"hands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness,"
"13214",1155,"but she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should"
"13215",1155,"go to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil."
"13216",1155,""
"13217",1155,"Tuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she"
"13218",1155,"saw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of"
"13219",1155,"mingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words"

"13224",1155,"credit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by"
"13225",1155,"magic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a"
"13226",1155,"moment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined"
"13227",1155,"nevertheless to be on the alert."
"13228",1155,""
"13229",1155,"Well, said Julius, I guess wed better make a move out of here any"

"13231",1155,""
"13232",1155,"The others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs."
"13233",1155,"Vandemeyers pulse."
"13234",1155,""
"13235",1155,"Perfectly satisfactory, he said in a low voice to Tuppence. Shell be"
"13236",1155,"absolutely all right after a nights rest."
"13237",1155,""
"13238",1155,"The girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression"
"13239",1155,"she had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted"
"13240",1155,"her lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her."
"13241",1155,""
"13242",1155,"Dont--leave---- she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something"
"13243",1155,"that sounded like sleepy. Then she tried again."

"13254",1155,""
"13255",1155,"A flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently"
"13256",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in"
"13257",1155,"Tuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: Mr. Brown? Tuppence"
"13258",1155,"caught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe"
"13259",1155,"loomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a"
"13260",1155,"man to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open"
"13261",1155,"and looked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under"
"13262",1155,"the bed. There was no other possible hiding-place."
"13263",1155,""
"13264",1155,"Tuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this"
"13265",1155,"giving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir"
"13266",1155,"James were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her."
"13267",1155,""
"13268",1155,"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the"
"13269",1155,"key. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room."

"13271",1155,"The gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed"
"13272",1155,"of her attack of nerves."
"13273",1155,""
"13274",1155,"Say, remarked Julius suddenly, theres Tuppences bright boy. I guess"
"13275",1155,"Id better go down and ease his young mind. Thats some lad, Tuppence."
"13276",1155,""
"13277",1155,"How did you get in, by the way? asked Tuppence suddenly. I forgot to"
"13278",1155,"ask."
"13279",1155,""
"13280",1155,"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James"
"13281",1155,"here, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was"
"13282",1155,"just a mite worried about what might have happened to you. Hed been"
"13283",1155,"listening outside the door of the flat, but couldnt hear anything."
"13284",1155,"Anyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing"
"13285",1155,"the bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along"
"13286",1155,"to find you. Alberts still below, and must be just hopping mad by this"
"13287",1155,"time. With which Julius departed abruptly."
"13288",1155,""
"13289",1155,"Now then, Miss Tuppence, said Sir James, you know this place better"
"13290",1155,"than I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?"
"13291",1155,""
"13292",1155,"Tuppence considered for a moment or two."
"13293",1155,""
"13294",1155,"I think Mrs. Vandemeyers boudoir would be the most comfortable, she"
"13295",1155,"said at last, and led the way there."

"13297",1155,"Sir James looked round approvingly."
"13298",1155,""
"13299",1155,"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and"
"13300",1155,"get some sleep."
"13301",1155,""
"13302",1155,"Tuppence shook her head resolutely."
"13303",1155,""
"13304",1155,"I couldnt, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all"
"13305",1155,"night!"
"13306",1155,""
"13307",1155,"But youll be so tired, child."
"13308",1155,""
"13309",1155,"No, I shant. Id rather stay up--really."
"13310",1155,""
"13311",1155,"The lawyer gave in."
"13312",1155,""
"13313",1155,"Julius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and"
"13314",1155,"rewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to"
"13315",1155,"persuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:"
"13316",1155,""
"13317",1155,"At any rate, youve got to have something to eat right away. Wheres"
"13318",1155,"the larder?"
"13319",1155,""
"13320",1155,"Tuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie"
"13321",1155,"and three plates."
"13322",1155,""
"13323",1155,"After a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of"
"13324",1155,"half an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail."
"13325",1155,""
"13326",1155,"And now, Miss Tuppence, said Sir James, we want to hear your"
"13327",1155,"adventures."

"13329",1155,"Thats so, agreed Julius."
"13330",1155,""
"13331",1155,"Tuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius"
"13332",1155,"occasionally interjected an admiring Bully. Sir James said nothing"
"13333",1155,"until she had finished, when his quiet well done, Miss Tuppence, made"
"13334",1155,"her flush with pleasure."
"13335",1155,""
"13336",1155,"Theres one thing I dont get clearly, said Julius. What put her up"
"13337",1155,"to clearing out?"
"13338",1155,""
"13339",1155,"I dont know, confessed Tuppence."
"13340",1155,""
"13341",1155,"Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully."
"13342",1155,""
"13343",1155,"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was"
"13344",1155,"unpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from"
"13345",1155,"some one."
"13346",1155,""
"13347",1155,"Mr. Brown, I suppose, said Julius scoffingly."
"13348",1155,""
"13349",1155,"The lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two."
"13350",1155,""
"13351",1155,"Why not? he said. Remember, you yourself have once been worsted by"
"13352",1155,"him."
"13353",1155,""
"13354",1155,"Julius flushed with vexation."
"13355",1155,""
"13356",1155,"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Janes photograph to"
"13357",1155,"him like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, Ill freeze on to"
"13358",1155,"it like--like hell!"
"13359",1155,""
"13360",1155,"That contingency is likely to be a remote one, said the other dryly."
"13361",1155,""
"13362",1155,"I guess youre right, said Julius frankly. And, in any case, its the"
"13363",1155,"original Im out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?"
"13364",1155,""
"13365",1155,"The lawyer shook his head."
"13366",1155,""
"13367",1155,"Impossible to say. But Ive a very good idea where she _has_ been."
"13368",1155,""
"13369",1155,"You have? Where?"
"13370",1155,""
"13371",1155,"Sir James smiled."
"13372",1155,""
"13373",1155,"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing"
"13374",1155,"home."
"13375",1155,""
"13376",1155,"There? Impossible. I asked."
"13377",1155,""
"13378",1155,"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been"
"13379",1155,"there. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly"
"13380",1155,"be under an assumed name."
"13381",1155,""
"13382",1155,"Bully for you, cried Julius. I never thought of that!"
"13383",1155,""
"13384",1155,"It was fairly obvious, said the other."
"13385",1155,""
"13386",1155,"Perhaps the doctors in it too, suggested Tuppence."
"13387",1155,""
"13388",1155,"Julius shook his head."
"13389",1155,""
"13390",1155,"I dont think so. I took to him at once. No, Im pretty sure Dr. Halls"
"13391",1155,"all right."
"13392",1155,""
"13393",1155,"Hall, did you say? asked Sir James. That is curious--really very"
"13394",1155,"curious."
"13395",1155,""
"13396",1155,"Why? demanded Tuppence."
"13397",1155,""
"13398",1155,"Because I happened to meet him this morning. Ive known him slightly on"
"13399",1155,"and off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street."
"13400",1155,"Staying at the _Mtropole_, he told me. He turned to Julius. Didnt"
"13401",1155,"he tell you he was coming up to town?"
"13402",1155,""
"13403",1155,"Julius shook his head."
"13404",1155,""
"13405",1155,"Curious, mused Sir James. You did not mention his name this"
"13406",1155,"afternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further"
"13407",1155,"information with my card as introduction."
"13408",1155,""
"13409",1155,"I guess Im a mutt, said Julius with unusual humility. I ought to"
"13410",1155,"have thought of the false name stunt."
"13411",1155,""
"13412",1155,"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree? cried"
"13413",1155,"Tuppence. Im sure anyone else would have been killed right off."
"13414",1155,""
"13415",1155,"Well, I guess it doesnt matter now, anyway, said Julius. Weve got"
"13416",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and thats all we need."
"13417",1155,""
"13418",1155,"Yes, said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice."
"13419",1155,""
"13420",1155,"A silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of"
"13421",1155,"the night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the"
"13422",1155,"furniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence"
"13423",1155,"sprang up with a cry."
"13424",1155,""
"13425",1155,"I cant help it. I know Mr. Browns somewhere in the flat! I can _feel_"

"13428",1155,"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This doors open into the hall. No"

"13430",1155,"him."
"13431",1155,""
"13432",1155,"I cant help it. I _feel_ hes here!"
"13433",1155,""
"13434",1155,"She looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:"
"13435",1155,""
"13436",1155,"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well"
"13437",1155,"for that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to"
"13438",1155,"be in the flat without our knowledge."
"13439",1155,""
"13440",1155,"The girl was a little comforted by his words."
"13441",1155,""
"13442",1155,"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy, she confessed."
"13443",1155,""
"13444",1155,"Yes, said Sir James. We are in the condition of people holding a"
"13445",1155,"sance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous"
"13446",1155,"results."
"13447",1155,""
"13448",1155,"Do you believe in spiritualism? asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide."

"13451",1155,""
"13452",1155,"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony"

"13455",1155,"The hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James"
"13456",1155,"drew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow"
"13457",1155,"rising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming"
"13458",1155,"of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd."
"13459",1155,"Tuppences spirits revived to the normal."
"13460",1155,""
"13461",1155,"Hooray! she said. Its going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find"

"13475",1155,"Yes, it does, admitted Tuppence. But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps"

"13484",1155,""
"13485",1155,"Supposing, after all, shes escaped? she murmured in a whisper."
"13486",1155,""
"13487",1155,"Plumb impossible, replied Julius reassuringly."
"13488",1155,""
"13489",1155,"But Sir James said nothing."
"13490",1155,""
"13491",1155,"Tuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as"
"13492",1155,"she saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed."
"13493",1155,""
"13494",1155,"Good morning, she remarked cheerfully. Ive brought you some tea."
"13495",1155,""
"13496",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table"
"13497",1155,"by the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs."
"13498",1155,"Vandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching"
"13499",1155,"at her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as"
"13500",1155,"ice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now...."
"13501",1155,""
"13502",1155,"Her cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer"
"13503",1155,"was dead--must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in her"
"13504",1155,"sleep."
"13505",1155,""
"13506",1155,"If that isnt the cruellest luck, cried Julius in despair."
"13507",1155,""
"13508",1155,"The lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes."
"13509",1155,""
"13510",1155,"If it is luck, he replied."
"13511",1155,""
"13512",1155,"You dont think--but, say, thats plumb impossible--no one could have"
"13513",1155,"got in."
"13514",1155,""
"13515",1155,"No, admitted the lawyer. I dont see how they could. And yet--she is"
"13516",1155,"on the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies. Is it only chance?"
"13517",1155,""
"13518",1155,"But how----"
"13519",1155,""
"13520",1155,"Yes, _how!_ That is what we must find out. He stood there silently,"
"13521",1155,"gently stroking his chin. We must find out, he said quietly, and"
"13522",1155,"Tuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of"
"13523",1155,"those simple words."
"13524",1155,""
"13525",1155,"Juliuss glance went to the window."
"13526",1155,""
"13527",1155,"The windows open, he remarked. Do you think----"
"13528",1155,""
"13529",1155,"Tuppence shook her head."
"13530",1155,""
"13531",1155,"The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there."
"13532",1155,""
"13533",1155,"He might have slipped out---- suggested Julius."
"13534",1155,""
"13535",1155,"But Sir James interrupted him."
"13536",1155,""
"13537",1155,"Mr. Browns methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for"
"13538",1155,"a doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might"
"13539",1155,"be of value to us?"
"13540",1155,""
"13541",1155,"Hastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated"
"13542",1155,"that Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight."
"13543",1155,"Nothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as"
"13544",1155,"well."
"13545",1155,""
"13546",1155,"Theres that, said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,"
"13547",1155,"old-fashioned safe let into the wall. Its for jewellery, I believe,"
"13548",1155,"but there might be something else in it."
"13549",1155,""
"13550",1155,"The key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched"
"13551",1155,"inside. He was some time over the task."
"13552",1155,""
"13553",1155,"Well, said Tuppence impatiently."
"13554",1155,""
"13555",1155,"There was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his head and"
"13556",1155,"shut to the door."
"13557",1155,""
"13558",1155,"Nothing, he said."
"13559",1155,""
"13560",1155,"In five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was"
"13561",1155,"deferential to Sir James, whom he recognized."
"13562",1155,""
"13563",1155,"Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught. He"
"13564",1155,"sniffed. Rather an odour of chloral in the air."
"13565",1155,""
"13566",1155,"Tuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove her to"
"13567",1155,"the washstand. She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer"
"13568",1155,"had poured a few drops."
"13569",1155,""
"13570",1155,"It had been three parts full. Now-- _it was empty_."

"13574",1155,"CHAPTER XIV. A CONSULTATION"
"13575",1155,""
"13576",1155,"NOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the ease"
"13577",1155,"and simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to Sir Jamess"
"13578",1155,"skilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs."
"13579",1155,"Vandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted"
"13580",1155,"whether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James"
"13581",1155,"know. He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for"
"13582",1155,"abroad, and that the servants had already left? Sir James and his young"
"13583",1155,"friends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly stricken"
"13584",1155,"down and they had spent the night in the flat, not liking to leave"
"13585",1155,"her alone. Did they know of any relatives? They did not, but Sir James"
"13586",1155,"referred him to Mrs. Vandemeyers solicitor."
"13587",1155,""
"13588",1155,"Shortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other left"
"13589",1155,"the ill-omened building."
"13590",1155,""
"13591",1155,"And what now? asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. I guess were"
"13592",1155,"down and out for good."
"13593",1155,""
"13594",1155,"Sir James stroked his chin thoughtfully."
"13595",1155,""
"13596",1155,"No, he said quietly. There is still the chance that Dr. Hall may be"
"13597",1155,"able to tell us something."
"13598",1155,""
"13599",1155,"Gee! Id forgotten him."
"13600",1155,""
"13601",1155,"The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I told you"
"13602",1155,"that he is staying at the _Mtropole_. I should suggest that we call"
"13603",1155,"upon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say after a bath and"
"13604",1155,"breakfast?"
"13605",1155,""
"13606",1155,"It was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the _Ritz_,"
"13607",1155,"and call for Sir James in the car. This programme was faithfully carried"
"13608",1155,"out, and a little after eleven they drew up before the _Mtropole_."
"13609",1155,"They asked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in search of him. In a few"
"13610",1155,"minutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them."
"13611",1155,""
"13612",1155,"Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall? said Sir James pleasantly."
"13613",1155,"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you"
"13614",1155,"already know."
"13615",1155,""
"13616",1155,"A quizzical gleam came into the doctors eye as he shook hands with"
"13617",1155,"Julius."
"13618",1155,""
"13619",1155,"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?"
"13620",1155,""
"13621",1155,"I guess its cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc."
"13622",1155,""
"13623",1155,"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!"
"13624",1155,""
"13625",1155,"Still searching, said Julius briefly."
"13626",1155,""
"13627",1155,"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private? asked"
"13628",1155,"Sir James."
"13629",1155,""
"13630",1155,"Certainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite"
"13631",1155,"undisturbed."
"13632",1155,""
"13633",1155,"He led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and the"
"13634",1155,"doctor looked inquiringly at Sir James."
"13635",1155,""
"13636",1155,"Dr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the"
"13637",1155,"purpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to believe"
"13638",1155,"that she has been at one time or another in your establishment at"
"13639",1155,"Bournemouth. I hope I am transgressing no professional etiquette in"
"13640",1155,"questioning you on the subject?"
"13641",1155,""
"13642",1155,"I suppose it is a matter of testimony?"
"13643",1155,""
"13644",1155,"Sir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:"
"13645",1155,""
"13646",1155,"Yes."
"13647",1155,""
"13648",1155,"I shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What is"
"13649",1155,"the young ladys name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I remember---- He half"
"13650",1155,"turned to Julius."
"13651",1155,""
"13652",1155,"The name, said Sir James bluntly, is really immaterial. She would be"
"13653",1155,"almost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I should like to"
"13654",1155,"know if you are acquainted with a Mrs. Vandemeyer?"
"13655",1155,""
"13656",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her slightly."
"13657",1155,""
"13658",1155,"You are not aware of what has happened?"
"13659",1155,""
"13660",1155,"What do you mean?"
"13661",1155,""
"13662",1155,"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?"
"13663",1155,""
"13664",1155,"Dear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?"
"13665",1155,""
"13666",1155,"She took an overdose of chloral last night."
"13667",1155,""
"13668",1155,"Purposely?"
"13669",1155,""
"13670",1155,"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself. Anyway,"
"13671",1155,"she was found dead this morning."
"13672",1155,""
"13673",1155,"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a friend of"
"13674",1155,"yours, since you are acquainted with all these details."
"13675",1155,""
"13676",1155,"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who found her"
"13677",1155,"dead."
"13678",1155,""
"13679",1155,"Indeed, said the doctor, starting."
"13680",1155,""
"13681",1155,"Yes, said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively."
"13682",1155,""
"13683",1155,"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not"
"13684",1155,"see how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?"
"13685",1155,""
"13686",1155,"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer"
"13687",1155,"committed a young relative of hers to your charge?"
"13688",1155,""
"13689",1155,"Julius leaned forward eagerly."
"13690",1155,""
"13691",1155,"That is the case, said the doctor quietly."
"13692",1155,""
"13693",1155,"Under the name of----?"
"13694",1155,""
"13695",1155,"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyers."
"13696",1155,""
"13697",1155,"And she came to you?"
"13698",1155,""
"13699",1155,"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915."
"13700",1155,""
"13701",1155,"Was she a mental case?"
"13702",1155,""
"13703",1155,"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood from Mrs."
"13704",1155,"Vandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the _Lusitania_ when"
"13705",1155,"that ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a severe shock in"
"13706",1155,"consequence."
"13707",1155,""
"13708",1155,"Were on the right track, I think? Sir James looked round."
"13709",1155,""
"13710",1155,"As I said before, Im a mutt! returned Julius."
"13711",1155,""
"13712",1155,"The doctor looked at them all curiously."
"13713",1155,""
"13714",1155,"You spoke of wanting a statement from her, he said. Supposing she is"
"13715",1155,"not able to give one?"
"13716",1155,""
"13717",1155,"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane."
"13718",1155,""
"13719",1155,"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning"
"13720",1155,"any events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to"
"13721",1155,"you."
"13722",1155,""
"13723",1155,"They looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully."
"13724",1155,""
"13725",1155,"Its a pity, he said. A great pity, especially as I gather, Sir"
"13726",1155,"James, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you"
"13727",1155,"nothing."
"13728",1155,""
"13729",1155,"But why, man? Darn it all, why?"
"13730",1155,""
"13731",1155,"The little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young"
"13732",1155,"American."
"13733",1155,""
"13734",1155,"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory."
"13735",1155,""
"13736",1155,"_What?_"
"13737",1155,""
"13738",1155,"Quite so. An interesting case, a _very_ interesting case. Not so"
"13739",1155,"uncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known"
"13740",1155,"parallels. Its the first case of the kind that Ive had under my own"
"13741",1155,"personal observation, and I must admit that Ive found it of absorbing"
"13742",1155,"interest. There was something rather ghoulish in the little mans"
"13743",1155,"satisfaction."
"13744",1155,""
"13745",1155,"And she remembers nothing, said Sir James slowly."
"13746",1155,""
"13747",1155,"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as good as"
"13748",1155,"yours or mine."
"13749",1155,""
"13750",1155,"Then the first thing she remembers?"
"13751",1155,""
"13752",1155,"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She"
"13753",1155,"did not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was."
"13754",1155,"She couldnt even speak her own tongue."
"13755",1155,""
"13756",1155,"But surely all this is most unusual? put in Julius."
"13757",1155,""
"13758",1155,"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to"
"13759",1155,"the nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same"
"13760",1155,"lines. I suggested a specialist, of course. Theres a very good man in"
"13761",1155,"Paris--makes a study of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the"
"13762",1155,"idea of publicity that might result from such a course."
"13763",1155,""
"13764",1155,"I can imagine she would, said Sir James grimly."
"13765",1155,""
"13766",1155,"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to these"
"13767",1155,"cases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed"
"13768",1155,"a pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might damage her"
"13769",1155,"prospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such"
"13770",1155,"cases. It is really a matter of waiting."
"13771",1155,""
"13772",1155,"Waiting?"
"13773",1155,""
"13774",1155,"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it"
"13775",1155,"went. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the"
"13776",1155,"intervening period, and will take up life where she left off--at the"
"13777",1155,"sinking of the _Lusitania_."
"13778",1155,""
"13779",1155,"And when do you expect this to happen?"
"13780",1155,""
"13781",1155,"The doctor shrugged his shoulders."
"13782",1155,""
"13783",1155,"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes"
"13784",1155,"it has been known to be as long as twenty years! Sometimes another shock"
"13785",1155,"does the trick. One restores what the other took away."
"13786",1155,""
"13787",1155,"Another shock, eh? said Julius thoughtfully."
"13788",1155,""
"13789",1155,"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado---- The little mans voice"
"13790",1155,"trailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic."
"13791",1155,""
"13792",1155,"Julius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own"
"13793",1155,"thoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown study,"
"13794",1155,"and hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist that every one"
"13795",1155,"jumped, the doctor most of all."
"13796",1155,""
"13797",1155,"Ive got it! I guess, doc, Id like your medical opinion on the plan"
"13798",1155,"Im about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and"
"13799",1155,"the same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one"
"13800",1155,"to take to the boats--and so on. Wouldnt that do the trick? Wouldnt it"
"13801",1155,"give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon"
"13802",1155,"is, and start it functioning again right away?"
"13803",1155,""
"13804",1155,"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it"
"13805",1155,"would be successful. It is unfortunate that there is no chance of the"
"13806",1155,"conditions repeating themselves as you suggest."
"13807",1155,""
"13808",1155,"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But Im talking about art."
"13809",1155,""
"13810",1155,"Art?"
"13811",1155,""
"13812",1155,"Why, yes. Whats the difficulty? Hire a liner----"
"13813",1155,""
"13814",1155,"A liner! murmured Dr. Hall faintly."
"13815",1155,""
"13816",1155,"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--thats the only difficulty, I"
"13817",1155,"guess. Governments are apt to be a bit hide-bound over their engines of"
"13818",1155,"war. They wont sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be got"
"13819",1155,"over. Ever heard of the word graft, sir? Well, graft gets there every"
"13820",1155,"time! I reckon that we shant really need to fire a torpedo. If every"
"13821",1155,"one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it"
"13822",1155,"ought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time"
"13823",1155,"shes got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with"
"13824",1155,"a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck,"
"13825",1155,"why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. Hows that"
"13826",1155,"for the bare outline?"
"13827",1155,""
"13828",1155,"Dr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment"

"14187",1155,"At the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed"
"14188",1155,"back her hair."
"14189",1155,""
"14190",1155,"Thats that, she observed sternly. Lets look facts in the face. I"
"14191",1155,"seem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who probably doesnt"
"14192",1155,"care two straws about me. Here she paused. Anyway, she resumed, as"
"14193",1155,"though arguing with an unseen opponent, I dont _know_ that he does."
"14194",1155,"Hed never have dared to say so. Ive always jumped on sentiment--and"
"14195",1155,"here I am being more sentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are!"
"14196",1155,"Ive always thought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph"
"14197",1155,"under my pillow, and dream about him all night. Its dreadful to feel"
"14198",1155,"youve been false to your principles."
"14199",1155,""
"14200",1155,"Tuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding."

"14202",1155,"I dont know what to say to Julius, Im sure. Oh, what a fool I feel!"
"14203",1155,"Ill have to say _something_--hes so American and thorough, hell"

"14205",1155,"safe----"
"14206",1155,""
"14207",1155,"Tuppences meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed the events"
"14208",1155,"of last night carefully and persistently. Somehow, they seemed bound up"
"14209",1155,"with Sir Jamess enigmatical words...."
"14210",1155,""
"14211",1155,"Suddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her face. Her"

"14214",1155,"Impossible, she murmured. Impossible! I must be going mad even to"
"14215",1155,"think of such a thing...."

"14217",1155,"Monstrous--yet it explained everything...."

"14219",1155,"After a moments reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each"
"14220",1155,"word as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and"
"14221",1155,"slipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius. She went"
"14222",1155,"down the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had"
"14223",1155,"expected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table."

"14235",1155,"CHAPTER XVI. FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY"
"14236",1155,""
"14237",1155,"FROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged"
"14238",1155,"his senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened his eyes, he was"
"14239",1155,"conscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples. He"
"14240",1155,"was vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings. Where was he? What had"
"14241",1155,"happened? He blinked feebly. This was not his bedroom at the _Ritz_. And"
"14242",1155,"what the devil was the matter with his head?"
"14243",1155,""
"14244",1155,"Damn! said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He was in"
"14245",1155,"that sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through"
"14246",1155,"his almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully."
"14247",1155,""
"14248",1155,"He is coming to, remarked a voice very near Tommys ear. He recognized"
"14249",1155,"it at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay"
"14250",1155,"artistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too"
"14251",1155,"soon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt"
"14252",1155,"quite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out"
"14253",1155,"what had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as"
"14254",1155,"he listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew"
"14255",1155,"him now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift."
"14256",1155,"Undoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore"
"14257",1155,"he need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own"
"14258",1155,"wits."
"14259",1155,""
"14260",1155,"Well, here goes, murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former"
"14261",1155,"remark."
"14262",1155,""
"14263",1155,"Damn! he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up."
"14264",1155,""
"14265",1155,"In a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips,"
"14266",1155,"with the brief command Drink. Tommy obeyed. The potency of the draught"
"14267",1155,"made him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner."
"14268",1155,""
"14269",1155,"He was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held."
"14270",1155,"On one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced"
"14271",1155,"doorkeeper who had let him in. The others were grouped together at a"
"14272",1155,"little distance away. But Tommy missed one face. The man known as Number"
"14273",1155,"One was no longer of the company."
"14274",1155,""
"14275",1155,"Feel better? asked the German, as he removed the empty glass."
"14276",1155,""
"14277",1155,"Yes, thanks, returned Tommy cheerfully."
"14278",1155,""
"14279",1155,"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick. The"
"14280",1155,"good Conrad struck hard. He indicated the evil-faced doorkeeper by a"
"14281",1155,"nod. The man grinned."
"14282",1155,""
"14283",1155,"Tommy twisted his head round with an effort."
"14284",1155,""
"14285",1155,"Oh, he said, so youre Conrad, are you? It strikes me the thickness"
"14286",1155,"of my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I feel its almost"
"14287",1155,"a pity Ive enabled you to cheat the hangman."
"14288",1155,""
"14289",1155,"The man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:"
"14290",1155,""
"14291",1155,"He would have run no risk of that."
"14292",1155,""
"14293",1155,"Just as you like, replied Tommy. I know its the fashion to run down"
"14294",1155,"the police. I rather believe in them myself."
"14295",1155,""
"14296",1155,"His manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford was one"
"14297",1155,"of those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual"
"14298",1155,"ability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a"
"14299",1155,"tight place. Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like"
"14300",1155,"a glove. Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only"
"14301",1155,"chance of escape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains"
"14302",1155,"furiously."
"14303",1155,""
"14304",1155,"The cold accents of the German took up the conversation:"
"14305",1155,""
"14306",1155,"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?"
"14307",1155,""
"14308",1155,"Simply lots of things, replied Tommy with the same urbanity as before."
"14309",1155,""
"14310",1155,"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?"
"14311",1155,""
"14312",1155,"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so"
"14313",1155,"interesting that it overcame my scruples."
"14314",1155,""
"14315",1155,"How did you get in?"
"14316",1155,""
"14317",1155,"Dear old Conrad here. Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. I hesitate"
"14318",1155,"to suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you really ought to"
"14319",1155,"have a better watchdog."
"14320",1155,""
"14321",1155,"Conrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the beard"
"14322",1155,"swung round upon him:"
"14323",1155,""
"14324",1155,"He gave the word. How was I to know?"
"14325",1155,""
"14326",1155,"Yes, Tommy chimed in. How was he to know? Dont blame the poor"
"14327",1155,"fellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all"
"14328",1155,"face to face."
"14329",1155,""
"14330",1155,"He fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group, but"
"14331",1155,"the watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand."
"14332",1155,""
"14333",1155,"Dead men tell no tales, he said evenly."
"14334",1155,""
"14335",1155,"Ah, said Tommy, but Im not dead yet!"
"14336",1155,""
"14337",1155,"You soon will be, my young friend, said the German."
"14338",1155,""
"14339",1155,"An assenting murmur came from the others."
"14340",1155,""
"14341",1155,"Tommys heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not waver."
"14342",1155,""
"14343",1155,"I think not, he said firmly. I should have a great objection to"
"14344",1155,"dying."
"14345",1155,""
"14346",1155,"He had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captors face."
"14347",1155,""
"14348",1155,"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death? asked"
"14349",1155,"the German."
"14350",1155,""
"14351",1155,"Several, replied Tommy. Look here, youve been asking me a lot of"
"14352",1155,"questions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didnt you kill me off"
"14353",1155,"at once before I regained consciousness?"
"14354",1155,""
"14355",1155,"The German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage."
"14356",1155,""
"14357",1155,"Because you didnt know how much I knew--and where I obtained that"
"14358",1155,"knowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know."
"14359",1155,""
"14360",1155,"But here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He stepped"
"14361",1155,"forward waving his arms."
"14362",1155,""
"14363",1155,"You hell-hound of a spy, he screamed. We will give you short shrift."
"14364",1155,"Kill him! Kill him!"
"14365",1155,""
"14366",1155,"There was a roar of applause."
"14367",1155,""
"14368",1155,"You hear? said the German, his eyes on Tommy. What have you to say to"
"14369",1155,"that?"
"14370",1155,""
"14371",1155,"Say? Tommy shrugged his shoulders. Pack of fools. Let them ask"
"14372",1155,"themselves a few questions. How did I get into this place? Remember what"
"14373",1155,"dear old Conrad said-- _with your own password_, wasnt it? How did I"
"14374",1155,"get hold of that? You dont suppose I came up those steps haphazard and"
"14375",1155,"said the first thing that came into my head?"
"14376",1155,""
"14377",1155,"Tommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His only"
"14378",1155,"regret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour."
"14379",1155,""
"14380",1155,"That is true, said the working man suddenly. Comrades, we have been"
"14381",1155,"betrayed!"
"14382",1155,""
"14383",1155,"An ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly."
"14384",1155,""
"14385",1155,"Thats better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if you"
"14386",1155,"dont use your brains?"
"14387",1155,""
"14388",1155,"You will tell us who has betrayed us, said the German. But that shall"
"14389",1155,"not save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you know. Boris, here,"
"14390",1155,"knows pretty ways of making people speak!"
"14391",1155,""
"14392",1155,"Bah! said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly unpleasant"
"14393",1155,"feeling in the pit of his stomach. You will neither torture me nor kill"
"14394",1155,"me."
"14395",1155,""
"14396",1155,"And why not? asked Boris."
"14397",1155,""
"14398",1155,"Because youd kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, replied Tommy"
"14399",1155,"quietly."
"14400",1155,""
"14401",1155,"There was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommys persistent"
"14402",1155,"assurance was at last conquering. They were no longer completely sure of"
"14403",1155,"themselves. The man in the shabby clothes stared at Tommy searchingly."
"14404",1155,""
"14405",1155,"Hes bluffing you, Boris, he said quietly."
"14406",1155,""
"14407",1155,"Tommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?"
"14408",1155,""
"14409",1155,"The German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy."
"14410",1155,""
"14411",1155,"What do you mean?"
"14412",1155,""
"14413",1155,"What do you think I mean? parried Tommy, searching desperately in his"
"14414",1155,"own mind."
"14415",1155,""
"14416",1155,"Suddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommys face."
"14417",1155,""
"14418",1155,"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!"
"14419",1155,""
"14420",1155,"Dont get so excited, my good fellow, said Tommy calmly. Thats the"
"14421",1155,"worst of you foreigners. You cant keep calm. Now, I ask you, do I look"
"14422",1155,"as though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me?"
"14423",1155,""
"14424",1155,"He looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the"
"14425",1155,"persistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words."
"14426",1155,""
"14427",1155,"No, admitted Boris at last sullenly, you do not."
"14428",1155,""
"14429",1155,"Thank God, hes not a mind reader, thought Tommy. Aloud he pursued his"
"14430",1155,"advantage:"
"14431",1155,""
"14432",1155,"And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts me in a"
"14433",1155,"position to propose a bargain."
"14434",1155,""
"14435",1155,"A bargain? The bearded man took him up sharply."
"14436",1155,""
"14437",1155,"Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against---- He paused."
"14438",1155,""
"14439",1155,"Against what?"
"14440",1155,""
"14441",1155,"The group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop."
"14442",1155,""
"14443",1155,"Slowly Tommy spoke."
"14444",1155,""
"14445",1155,"The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the _Lusitania_."
"14446",1155,""
"14447",1155,"The effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his feet."
"14448",1155,"The German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face purple with"
"14449",1155,"excitement."
"14450",1155,""
"14451",1155,"_Himmel!_ You have got them, then?"
"14452",1155,""
"14453",1155,"With magnificent calm Tommy shook his head."
"14454",1155,""
"14455",1155,"You know where they are? persisted the German."
"14456",1155,""
"14457",1155,"Again Tommy shook his head. Not in the least."
"14458",1155,""
"14459",1155,"Then--then---- angry and baffled, the words failed him."
"14460",1155,""
"14461",1155,"Tommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face, but his"
"14462",1155,"calm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that something lay"
"14463",1155,"behind his words."
"14464",1155,""
"14465",1155,"I dont know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find them."
"14466",1155,"I have a theory----"
"14467",1155,""
"14468",1155,"Pah!"
"14469",1155,""
"14470",1155,"Tommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust."
"14471",1155,""
"14472",1155,"I call it a theory--but Im pretty sure of my facts--facts that are"
"14473",1155,"known to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If I can"
"14474",1155,"produce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in exchange. Is it a"
"14475",1155,"bargain?"
"14476",1155,""
"14477",1155,"And if we refuse? said the German quietly."
"14478",1155,""
"14479",1155,"Tommy lay back on the couch."
"14480",1155,""
"14481",1155,"The 29th, he said thoughtfully, is less than a fortnight ahead----"
"14482",1155,""
"14483",1155,"For a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to Conrad."
"14484",1155,""
"14485",1155,"Take him into the other room."
"14486",1155,""
"14487",1155,"For five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door. His"
"14488",1155,"heart was beating violently. He had risked all on this throw. How would"
"14489",1155,"they decide? And all the while that this agonized questioning went on"
"14490",1155,"within him, he talked flippantly to Conrad, enraging the cross-grained"
"14491",1155,"doorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania."
"14492",1155,""
"14493",1155,"At last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to Conrad to"

"14496",1155,"Lets hope the judge hasnt put his black cap on, remarked Tommy"

"14499",1155,""
"14500",1155,"The German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to Tommy"

"14509",1155,"What do you expect, then?"

"14518",1155,"No, said Tommy thoughtfully. Though infinitely simpler for me, I"

"14520",1155,"arrange a compromise. How would it be if you attached little Conrad here"
"14521",1155,"to my person. Hes a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist."

"14534",1155,"Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!"
"14535",1155,""
"14536",1155,"Tommy leaned back wearily."
"14537",1155,""
"14538",1155,"I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But one thing"
"14539",1155,"is essential, I must see the girl."
"14540",1155,""
"14541",1155,"What girl?"
"14542",1155,""
"14543",1155,"Jane Finn, of course."
"14544",1155,""
"14545",1155,"The other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said slowly,"
"14546",1155,"and as though choosing his words with care:"
"14547",1155,""
"14548",1155,"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?"
"14549",1155,""
"14550",1155,"Tommys heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming face to"
"14551",1155,"face with the girl he was seeking?"
"14552",1155,""
"14553",1155,"I shall not ask her to tell me anything, he said quietly. Not in so"
"14554",1155,"many words, that is."
"14555",1155,""
"14556",1155,"Then why see her?"
"14557",1155,""
"14558",1155,"Tommy paused."
"14559",1155,""
"14560",1155,"To watch her face when I ask her one question, he replied at last."
"14561",1155,""
"14562",1155,"Again there was a look in the Germans eyes that Tommy did not quite"
"14563",1155,"understand."
"14564",1155,""
"14565",1155,"She will not be able to answer your question."
"14566",1155,""
"14567",1155,"That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it."
"14568",1155,""
"14569",1155,"And you think that will tell you anything? He gave a short"
"14570",1155,"disagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a"
"14571",1155,"factor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at"
"14572",1155,"him searchingly. I wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we"
"14573",1155,"think? he said softly."
"14574",1155,""
"14575",1155,"Tommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His hold had"
"14576",1155,"slipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said wrong? He spoke"
"14577",1155,"out on the impulse of the moment."
"14578",1155,""
"14579",1155,"There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not pretended"
"14580",1155,"to be aware of all the details of your show. But equally Ive got"
"14581",1155,"something up my sleeve that _you_ dont know about. And thats where I"
"14582",1155,"mean to score. Danvers was a damned clever fellow---- He broke off as"
"14583",1155,"if he had said too much."
"14584",1155,""
"14585",1155,"But the Germans face had lightened a little."
"14586",1155,""
"14587",1155,"Danvers, he murmured. I see---- He paused a minute, then waved to"
"14588",1155,"Conrad. Take him away. Upstairs--you know."
"14589",1155,""
"14590",1155,"Wait a minute, said Tommy. What about the girl?"
"14591",1155,""
"14592",1155,"That may perhaps be arranged."
"14593",1155,""
"14594",1155,"It must be."
"14595",1155,""
"14596",1155,"We will see about it. Only one person can decide that."
"14597",1155,""
"14598",1155,"Who? asked Tommy. But he knew the answer."
"14599",1155,""
"14600",1155,"Mr. Brown----"
"14601",1155,""
"14602",1155,"Shall I see him?"
"14603",1155,""
"14604",1155,"Perhaps."
"14605",1155,""
"14606",1155,"Come, said Conrad harshly."
"14607",1155,""
"14608",1155,"Tommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to"
"14609",1155,"mount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On the floor above"
"14610",1155,"Conrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room. Conrad lit a"
"14611",1155,"hissing gas burner and went out. Tommy heard the sound of the key being"
"14612",1155,"turned in the lock."
"14613",1155,""
"14614",1155,"He set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than the"
"14615",1155,"one downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless about the"
"14616",1155,"atmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no window. He walked"
"14617",1155,"round it. The walls were filthily dirty, as everywhere else. Four"
"14618",1155,"pictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust."
"14619",1155,"Marguerite with her box of jewels, the church scene, Siebel and his"
"14620",1155,"flowers, and Faust and Mephistopheles. The latter brought Tommys mind"
"14621",1155,"back to Mr. Brown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its"
"14622",1155,"close-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the"
"14623",1155,"sinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would,"
"14624",1155,"no one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb...."
"14625",1155,""
"14626",1155,"With an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the bed"
"14627",1155,"and gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly; also, he was"
"14628",1155,"hungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting."
"14629",1155,""
"14630",1155,"Anyway, said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, I shall see the"
"14631",1155,"chief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing I"
"14632",1155,"shall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After that----"

"14639",1155,""
"14640",1155,"THE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the troubles of"
"14641",1155,"the present. And of these, the most immediate and pressing was that of"
"14642",1155,"hunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite. The steak and"
"14643",1155,"chips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade. He"
"14644",1155,"regretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a"
"14645",1155,"hunger strike."
"14646",1155,""
"14647",1155,"He prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he discarded"
"14648",1155,"dignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered the summons."
"14649",1155,""
"14650",1155,"Hang it all! said Tommy indignantly. They cant mean to starve me"
"14651",1155,"to death. A new-born fear passed through his mind that this might,"
"14652",1155,"perhaps, be one of those pretty ways of making a prisoner speak, which"
"14653",1155,"had been attributed to Boris. But on reflection he dismissed the idea."
"14654",1155,""
"14655",1155,"Its that sour-faced brute Conrad, he decided. Thats a fellow I"
"14656",1155,"shall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is just a bit of"
"14657",1155,"spite on his part. Im certain of it."
"14658",1155,""
"14659",1155,"Further meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be"
"14660",1155,"extremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrads"
"14661",1155,"egg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself"
"14662",1155,"up to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a bright idea flashed"
"14663",1155,"across his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad"
"14664",1155,"was undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible"
"14665",1155,"exception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous."
"14666",1155,"Therefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when"
"14667",1155,"he entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly"
"14668",1155,"on to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard."
"14669",1155,"And then--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down,"
"14670",1155,"well---- Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists."
"14671",1155,"Such an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter"
"14672",1155,"of this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the"
"14673",1155,"picture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His"
"14674",1155,"hopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent."
"14675",1155,""
"14676",1155,"Time went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the same"
"14677",1155,"in this prison room, but Tommys wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain"
"14678",1155,"degree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine oclock in the"
"14679",1155,"evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon"
"14680",1155,"it would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten oclock hope"
"14681",1155,"deserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in"
"14682",1155,"sleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten."
"14683",1155,""
"14684",1155,"The sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers."
"14685",1155,"Not belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full"
"14686",1155,"possession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and"
"14687",1155,"wondered vaguely where he was. Then he remembered, and looked at his"
"14688",1155,"watch. It was eight oclock."
"14689",1155,""

"14693",1155,"The door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of"
"14694",1155,"obliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was glad that"
"14695",1155,"he had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a"
"14696",1155,"tray which she set down on the table."
"14697",1155,""
"14698",1155,"In the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He decided"
"14699",1155,"at once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen."
"14700",1155,"Her hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as"
"14701",1155,"though there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There"
"14702",1155,"was a wild-rose quality about her face. Her eyes, set wide apart, were"
"14703",1155,"hazel, a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams."

"14705",1155,"A delirious thought shot through Tommys mind."

"14720",1155,""
"14721",1155,"The girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and inspected the"
"14722",1155,"contents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some margarine, and a jug"
"14723",1155,"of coffee."

"14764",1155,"No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we cant always"

"14766",1155,"know? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of onions is unmistakable."

"14768",1155,"Talk away, grunted the man. Its little enough time youll have to"
"14769",1155,"talk in, maybe."

"14778",1155,"again accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk trying to make"
"14779",1155,"an ally of her? He decided that he must leave no stone unturned. His"

"14782",1155,"At eight oclock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring"

"14834",1155,"I know nothing--only the name. She walked towards the door. Suddenly"

"14837",1155,"look of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief. Then"
"14838",1155,"abruptly she went out of the room. Tommy could make nothing of it. Did"
"14839",1155,"she fancy that he had meant to attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung"

"14841",1155,""
"14842",1155,"Three more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the strain"
"14843",1155,"telling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and Annette, and the"
"14844",1155,"girl had become dumb. She spoke only in monosyllables. A kind of dark"
"14845",1155,"suspicion smouldered in her eyes. Tommy felt that if this solitary"
"14846",1155,"confinement went on much longer he would go mad. He gathered from Conrad"
"14847",1155,"that they were waiting for orders from Mr. Brown. Perhaps, thought"
"14848",1155,"Tommy, he was abroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his"
"14849",1155,"return."

"14877",1155,"Tommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed. Somehow"
"14878",1155,"or other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions."
"14879",1155,"Suddenly a thought occurred to him."
"14880",1155,""
"14881",1155,"A very good speech, Conrad, he said approvingly. But wherefore the"
"14882",1155,"bonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat"
"14883",1155,"without delay?"
"14884",1155,""
"14885",1155,"Garn, said Number 14 unexpectedly. Think were as green as to do you"
"14886",1155,"in here, and have the police nosing round? Not alf! Weve ordered the"
"14887",1155,"carriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin, but in the meantime were"
"14888",1155,"not taking any chances, see!"
"14889",1155,""
"14890",1155,"Nothing, said Tommy, could be plainer than your words--unless it was"
"14891",1155,"your face."
"14892",1155,""
"14893",1155,"Stow it, said Number 14."
"14894",1155,""
"14895",1155,"With pleasure, replied Tommy. Youre making a sad mistake--but yours"
"14896",1155,"will be the loss."
"14897",1155,""
"14898",1155,"You dont kid us that way again, said Number 14. Talking as though"
"14899",1155,"you were still at the blooming _Ritz_, arent you?"
"14900",1155,""
"14901",1155,"Tommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had"
"14902",1155,"discovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the throes of"
"14903",1155,"anxiety, had gone to the police, and that his disappearance having been"
"14904",1155,"made public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together."
"14905",1155,""
"14906",1155,"The two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his"
"14907",1155,"meditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt cramped"
"14908",1155,"and stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no hope anywhere."
"14909",1155,""
"14910",1155,"About an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and the"
"14911",1155,"door opened. It was Annette. Tommys heart beat a little faster. He had"
"14912",1155,"forgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had come to his help?"
"14913",1155,""
"14914",1155,"Suddenly he heard Conrads voice:"
"14915",1155,""
"14916",1155,"Come out of it, Annette. He doesnt want any supper to-night."
"14917",1155,""
"14918",1155,"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need the"
"14919",1155,"things on it."
"14920",1155,""
"14921",1155,"Well, hurry up, growled Conrad."
"14922",1155,""
"14923",1155,"Without looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and picked up"
"14924",1155,"the tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light."
"14925",1155,""
"14926",1155,"Curse you--Conrad had come to the door--why did you do that?"
"14927",1155,""
"14928",1155,"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight it,"
"14929",1155,"Monsieur Conrad?"
"14930",1155,""
"14931",1155,"No, come on out of it."
"14932",1155,""
"14933",1155,"Le beau petit monsieur, cried Annette, pausing by the bed in the"
"14934",1155,"darkness. You have tied him up well, _hein?_ He is like a trussed"
"14935",1155,"chicken! The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at"
"14936",1155,"that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over"
"14937",1155,"his bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his"
"14938",1155,"hand."
"14939",1155,""
"14940",1155,"Come on, Annette."
"14941",1155,""
"14942",1155,"Mais me voil."
"14943",1155,""
"14944",1155,"The door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:"
"14945",1155,""
"14946",1155,"Lock it and give me the key."
"14947",1155,""
"14948",1155,"The footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object"
"14949",1155,"Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open."
"14950",1155,"From the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action"
"14951",1155,"with the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked."
"14952",1155,"There must be a peep-hole somewhere in the walls. Remembering how"
"14953",1155,"guarded she had always been in her manner, he saw that he had probably"
"14954",1155,"been under observation all the time. Had he said anything to give"
"14955",1155,"himself away? Hardly. He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire"
"14956",1155,"to find Jane Finn, but nothing that could have given a clue to his"
"14957",1155,"own identity. True, his question to Annette had proved that he was"
"14958",1155,"personally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended"
"14959",1155,"otherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her"
"14960",1155,"denials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could"
"14961",1155,"come to no conclusion."
"14962",1155,""
"14963",1155,"But there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he,"
"14964",1155,"bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to"
"14965",1155,"rub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists"
"14966",1155,"together. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered Ow of pain"
"14967",1155,"from him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he"
"14968",1155,"went on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt"
"14969",1155,"the cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes"
"14970",1155,"later he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his"
"14971",1155,"limbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on"
"14972",1155,"the edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so"
"14973",1155,"he could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet"
"14974",1155,"from the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait"
"14975",1155,"until the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did.... Tommy"
"14976",1155,"smiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and"
"14977",1155,"unhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his"
"14978",1155,"first plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait."
"14979",1155,"He waited."
"14980",1155,""
"14981",1155,"The night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of hours, but"
"14982",1155,"at last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a deep breath, and"
"14983",1155,"clutched the picture firmly."
"14984",1155,""
"14985",1155,"The door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went"
"14986",1155,"straight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was"
"14987",1155,"he who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with"
"14988",1155,"Conrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy"
"14989",1155,"brought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went"
"14990",1155,"down amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had"
"14991",1155,"slipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned"
"14992",1155,"it and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from"
"14993",1155,"the inside with a volley of curses."
"14994",1155,""
"14995",1155,"For a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one stirring"
"14996",1155,"on the floor below. Then the Germans voice came up the stairs."
"14997",1155,""
"14998",1155,"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?"
"14999",1155,""
"15000",1155,"Tommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood Annette. She"
"15001",1155,"pointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics."
"15002",1155,""
"15003",1155,"Quick--up here! She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another"
"15004",1155,"moment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber. Tommy"
"15005",1155,"looked round."
"15006",1155,""
"15007",1155,"This wont do. Its a regular trap. Theres no way out."
"15008",1155,""
"15009",1155,"Hush! Wait. The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to the top"
"15010",1155,"of the ladder and listened."
"15011",1155,""
"15012",1155,"The banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and another"
"15013",1155,"were trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a whisper:"
"15014",1155,""
"15015",1155,"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what Conrad"
"15016",1155,"says. The door is too thick."
"15017",1155,""
"15018",1155,"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?"
"15019",1155,""
"15020",1155,"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you to guess."
"15021",1155,"But they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in."
"15022",1155,""
"15023",1155,"Yes--but look here----"
"15024",1155,""
"15025",1155,"Leave it to me. She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw that she"
"15026",1155,"was fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big"
"15027",1155,"cracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then turned to Tommy."
"15028",1155,""
"15029",1155,"Have you the key of the door?"
"15030",1155,""
"15031",1155,"Yes."
"15032",1155,""
"15033",1155,"Give it to me."
"15034",1155,""
"15035",1155,"He handed it to her."
"15036",1155,""
"15037",1155,"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing"
"15038",1155,"yourself down _behind_ the ladder, so that they will not see you?"
"15039",1155,""
"15040",1155,"Tommy nodded."
"15041",1155,""
"15042",1155,"Theres a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand behind it."
"15043",1155,"Take the end of this string in your hand. When Ive let the others out--"
"15044",1155,"_pull! _"
"15045",1155,""
"15046",1155,"Before he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted lightly"
"15047",1155,"down the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry:"
"15048",1155,""
"15049",1155,"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Quest-ce quil y a?"
"15050",1155,""
"15051",1155,"The German turned on her with an oath."
"15052",1155,""
"15053",1155,"Get out of this. Go to your room!"
"15054",1155,""
"15055",1155,"Very cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder. So"
"15056",1155,"long as they did not turn round ... all was well. He crouched behind the"
"15057",1155,"cupboard. They were still between him and the stairs."
"15058",1155,""
"15059",1155,"Ah! Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped. Mon"
"15060",1155,"Dieu, voil la clef!"
"15061",1155,""
"15062",1155,"The German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad stumbled"
"15063",1155,"out, swearing."
"15064",1155,""
"15065",1155,"Where is he? Have you got him?"
"15066",1155,""
"15067",1155,"We have seen no one, said the German sharply. His face paled. Who do"
"15068",1155,"you mean?"
"15069",1155,""
"15070",1155,"Conrad gave vent to another oath."
"15071",1155,""
"15072",1155,"Hes got away."
"15073",1155,""
"15074",1155,"Impossible. He would have passed us."
"15075",1155,""
"15076",1155,"At that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A crash"
"15077",1155,"of crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men were pushing"
"15078",1155,"each other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness"
"15079",1155,"above."
"15080",1155,""
"15081",1155,"Quick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the"
"15082",1155,"stairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He"
"15083",1155,"fumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung"
"15084",1155,"open. He turned. Annette had disappeared."
"15085",1155,""
"15086",1155,"Tommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness"
"15087",1155,"possessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground. He"
"15088",1155,"would not go without her."
"15089",1155,""
"15090",1155,"And suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from the"
"15091",1155,"German, and then Annettes voice, clear and high:"
"15092",1155,""
"15093",1155,"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought it?"
"15094",1155,""
"15095",1155,"Tommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to him to go?"
"15096",1155,"He fancied it was."
"15097",1155,""
"15098",1155,"And then, louder still, the words floated down to him:"
"15099",1155,""
"15100",1155,"This is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To"
"15101",1155,"Marguerite. _To Marguerite!_"
"15102",1155,""
"15103",1155,"Tommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave her."
"15104",1155,"But why? At all costs he must try and get her away with him. Then his"
"15105",1155,"heart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs, uttering a savage cry at"
"15106",1155,"the sight of him. After him came the others."
"15107",1155,""
"15108",1155,"Tommy stopped Conrads rush with a straight blow with his fist. It"
"15109",1155,"caught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log. The"
"15110",1155,"second man tripped over his body and fell. From higher up the staircase"
"15111",1155,"there was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommys ear. He realized that"
"15112",1155,"it would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as"
"15113",1155,"possible. As regards Annette he could do nothing. He had got even with"
"15114",1155,"Conrad, which was one satisfaction. The blow had been a good one."
"15115",1155,""
"15116",1155,"He leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was deserted."
"15117",1155,"In front of the house was a bakers van. Evidently he was to have been"
"15118",1155,"taken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the"
"15119",1155,"house in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar"
"15120",1155,"Tommys way. Again Tommys fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the"
"15121",1155,"pavement."
"15122",1155,""
"15123",1155,"Tommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door opened"
"15124",1155,"and a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He"
"15125",1155,"turned the corner of the square."
"15126",1155,""
"15127",1155,"Theres one thing, he thought to himself, they cant go on shooting."
"15128",1155,"Theyll have the police after them if they do. I wonder they dared to"
"15129",1155,"there."
"15130",1155,""
"15131",1155,"He heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own"
"15132",1155,"pace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be"
"15133",1155,"a policeman about somewhere--not that he really wanted to invoke the aid"
"15134",1155,"of the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations,"
"15135",1155,"and general awkwardness. In another moment he had reason to bless his"
"15136",1155,"luck. He stumbled over a prostrate figure, which started up with a yell"
"15137",1155,"of alarm and dashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway."
"15138",1155,"In a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom the"
"15139",1155,"German was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!"
"15140",1155,""
"15141",1155,"Tommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to"
"15142",1155,"elapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently in the"
"15143",1155,"opposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a little after"
"15144",1155,"half-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At the next corner he"
"15145",1155,"passed a policeman. The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him. Tommy"
"15146",1155,"felt slightly offended. Then, passing his hand over his face, he"
"15147",1155,"laughed. He had not shaved or washed for three days! What a guy he must"
"15148",1155,"look."
"15149",1155,""
"15150",1155,"He betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which"
"15151",1155,"he knew to be open all night. He emerged into the busy daylight feeling"
"15152",1155,"himself once more, and able to make plans."
"15153",1155,""
"15154",1155,"First of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since"
"15155",1155,"midday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and"
"15156",1155,"bacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up"
"15157",1155,"in front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on"
"15158",1155,"Kramenin, who was described as the man behind Bolshevism in Russia,"
"15159",1155,"and who had just arrived in London--some thought as an unofficial envoy."
"15160",1155,"His career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he,"
"15161",1155,"and not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian"
"15162",1155,"Revolution."
"15163",1155,""
"15164",1155,"In the centre of the page was his portrait."

"15166",1155,"So thats who Number 1 is, said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and"
"15167",1155,"bacon. Not a doubt about it, I must push on."
"15168",1155,""
"15169",1155,"He paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he"
"15170",1155,"sent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes"
"15171",1155,"later he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name"
"15172",1155,"of Mr. Carter. There was a frown on his face."
"15173",1155,""
"15174",1155,"Look here, youve no business to come asking for me in this way. I"

"15185",1155,""
"15186",1155,"Quite right. Every moments of value. Fear we shall be too late anyway."
"15187",1155,"They wouldnt wait. Would clear out at once. Still, they may have left"
"15188",1155,"something behind them that will be a clue. You say youve recognized"
"15189",1155,"Number 1 to be Kramenin? Thats important. We want something against him"
"15190",1155,"badly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about"
"15191",1155,"the others? You say two faces were familiar to you? Ones a Labour man,"
"15192",1155,"you think? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot him."
"15193",1155,""
"15194",1155,"A minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise."
"15195",1155,""
"15196",1155,"Ah, Westway! Shouldnt have thought it. Poses as being moderate. As for"
"15197",1155,"the other fellow, I think I can give a good guess. He handed another"
"15198",1155,"photograph to Tommy, and smiled at the others exclamation. Im right,"
"15199",1155,"then. Who is he? Irishman. Prominent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of"
"15200",1155,"course. Weve suspected it--but couldnt get any proof. Yes, youve done"
"15201",1155,"very well, young man. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very"
"15202",1155,"little time--very little time indeed."
"15203",1155,""
"15204",1155,"But---- Tommy hesitated."
"15205",1155,""
"15206",1155,"Mr. Carter read his thoughts."
"15207",1155,""
"15208",1155,"We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. Its a"
"15209",1155,"toss-up--but weve got a sporting chance! But if that draft treaty turns"
"15210",1155,"up--were done. England will be plunged in anarchy. Ah, whats that?"
"15211",1155,"The car? Come on, Beresford, well go and have a look at this house of"
"15212",1155,"yours."
"15213",1155,""
"15214",1155,"Two constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An inspector"
"15215",1155,"reported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter turned to Tommy."
"15216",1155,""
"15217",1155,"The birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over it."
"15218",1155,""
"15219",1155,"Going over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the"
"15220",1155,"character of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The prison"
"15221",1155,"room with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the attic, the meeting"
"15222",1155,"room with its long table. But nowhere was there a trace of papers."
"15223",1155,"Everything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away. And"
"15224",1155,"there was no sign of Annette."
"15225",1155,""
"15226",1155,"What you tell me about the girl puzzled me, said Mr. Carter. You"
"15227",1155,"believe that she deliberately went back?"
"15228",1155,""
"15229",1155,"It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting the door"
"15230",1155,"open."
"15231",1155,""
"15232",1155,"Hm, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman, didnt feel"
"15233",1155,"like standing by to see a personable young man killed. But evidently"
"15234",1155,"shes in with them, or she wouldnt have gone back."
"15235",1155,""
"15236",1155,"I cant believe shes really one of them, sir. She--seemed so"
"15237",1155,"different----"
"15238",1155,""
"15239",1155,"Good-looking, I suppose? said Mr. Carter with a smile that made Tommy"
"15240",1155,"flush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annettes beauty rather"
"15241",1155,"shamefacedly."
"15242",1155,""
"15243",1155,"By the way, observed Mr. Carter, have you shown yourself to Miss"
"15244",1155,"Tuppence yet? Shes been bombarding me with letters about you."
"15245",1155,""
"15246",1155,"Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go to the"
"15247",1155,"police?"
"15248",1155,""
"15249",1155,"Mr. Carter shook his head."
"15250",1155,""
"15251",1155,"Then I wonder how they twigged me."
"15252",1155,""
"15253",1155,"Mr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The other"
"15254",1155,"nodded thoughtfully."
"15255",1155,""
"15256",1155,"True, thats rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the _Ritz_"
"15257",1155,"was an accidental remark?"
"15258",1155,""
"15259",1155,"It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me suddenly"
"15260",1155,"in some way."
"15261",1155,""
"15262",1155,"Well, said Mr. Carter, looking round him, theres nothing more to be"
"15263",1155,"done here. What about some lunch with me?"
"15264",1155,""
"15265",1155,"Thanks awfully, sir. But I think Id better get back and rout out"
"15266",1155,"Tuppence."
"15267",1155,""
"15268",1155,"Of course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe youre"
"15269",1155,"killed too readily next time."
"15270",1155,""
"15271",1155,"Tommy grinned."
"15272",1155,""
"15273",1155,"I take a lot of killing, sir."
"15274",1155,""
"15275",1155,"So I perceive, said Mr. Carter dryly. Well, good-bye. Remember youre"
"15276",1155,"a marked man now, and take reasonable care of yourself."
"15277",1155,""
"15278",1155,"Thank you, sir."
"15279",1155,""
"15280",1155,"Hailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to the"
"15281",1155,"_Ritz_, dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of startling"
"15282",1155,"Tuppence."
"15283",1155,""
"15284",1155,"Wonder what shes been up to. Dogging Rita most likely. By the way,"
"15285",1155,"I suppose thats who Annette meant by Marguerite. I didnt get it at the"
"15286",1155,"time. The thought saddened him a little, for it seemed to prove that"

"15295",1155,"CHAPTER XVIII. THE TELEGRAM"
"15296",1155,""
"15297",1155,"BAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and ordered"
"15298",1155,"a meal of surpassing excellence. His four days imprisonment had taught"
"15299",1155,"him anew to value good food."
"15300",1155,""
"15301",1155,"He was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole"
"15302",1155," la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering"
"15303",1155,"the room. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the"
"15304",1155,"others attention. At the sight of Tommy, Juliuss eyes seemed as though"
"15305",1155,"they would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled"
"15306",1155,"Tommys hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour."
"15307",1155,""
"15308",1155,"Holy snakes! he ejaculated. Is it really you?"
"15309",1155,""
"15310",1155,"Of course it is. Why shouldnt it be?"
"15311",1155,""
"15312",1155,"Why shouldnt it be? Say, man, dont you know youve been given up"
"15313",1155,"for dead? I guess wed have had a solemn requiem for you in another few"
"15314",1155,"days."
"15315",1155,""
"15316",1155,"Who thought I was dead? demanded Tommy."

"15318",1155,"Tuppence."
"15319",1155,""
"15320",1155,"She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I suppose. There"
"15321",1155,"must be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Where"
"15322",1155,"is Tuppence, by the way?"
"15323",1155,""
"15324",1155,"Isnt she here?"
"15325",1155,""
"15326",1155,"No, the fellows at the office said shed just gone out."
"15327",1155,""
"15328",1155,"Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour"
"15329",1155,"ago. But, say, cant you shed that British calm of yours, and get down"
"15330",1155,"to it? What on Gods earth have you been doing all this time?"
"15331",1155,""
"15332",1155,"If youre feeding here, replied Tommy, order now. Its going to be a"
"15333",1155,"long story."
"15334",1155,""
"15335",1155,"Julius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table, summoned a"
"15336",1155,"hovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he turned to Tommy."
"15337",1155,""
"15338",1155,"Fire ahead. I guess youve had some few adventures."
"15339",1155,""
"15340",1155,"One or two, replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his recital."
"15341",1155,""
"15342",1155,"Julius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed before him"
"15343",1155,"he forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh."
"15344",1155,""
"15345",1155,"Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!"
"15346",1155,""
"15347",1155,"And now for the home front, said Tommy, stretching out his hand for a"
"15348",1155,"peach."
"15349",1155,""
"15350",1155,"We-el, drawled Julius, I dont mind admitting weve had some"
"15351",1155,"adventures too."
"15352",1155,""
"15353",1155,"He, in his turn, assumed the rle of narrator. Beginning with his"
"15354",1155,"unsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his return"
"15355",1155,"to London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of Tuppence,"
"15356",1155,"the call upon Sir James, and the sensational occurrences of the previous"
"15357",1155,"night."
"15358",1155,""
"15359",1155,"But who killed her? asked Tommy. I dont quite understand."

"15361",1155,"The doctor kidded himself she took it herself, replied Julius dryly."
"15362",1155,""
"15363",1155,"And Sir James? What did he think?"
"15364",1155,""
"15365",1155,"Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster, replied Julius."
"15366",1155,"I should say he reserved judgment. He went on to detail the events"
"15367",1155,"of the morning."
"15368",1155,""
"15369",1155,"Lost her memory, eh? said Tommy with interest. By Jove, that explains"
"15370",1155,"why they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of questioning her. Bit of"
"15371",1155,"a slip on my part, that! But it wasnt the sort of thing a fellow would"
"15372",1155,"be likely to guess."
"15373",1155,""
"15374",1155,"They didnt give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?"

"15377",1155,""
"15378",1155,"Not a word. Im a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have got more"
"15379",1155,"out of them somehow."
"15380",1155,""
"15381",1155,"I guess youre lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was the"

"15383",1155,"a frazzle!"
"15384",1155,""
"15385",1155,"I was in such a funk I had to think of something, said Tommy simply."
"15386",1155,""
"15387",1155,"There was a moments pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyers"
"15388",1155,"death."
"15389",1155,""
"15390",1155,"Theres no doubt it was chloral?"
"15391",1155,""
"15392",1155,"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an"
"15393",1155,"overdose, or some such claptrap. Its all right. We dont want to"
"15394",1155,"be worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I and even the"
"15395",1155,"highbrow Sir James have all got the same idea."
"15396",1155,""
"15397",1155,"Mr. Brown? hazarded Tommy."
"15398",1155,""
"15399",1155,"Sure thing."
"15400",1155,""
"15401",1155,"Tommy nodded."
"15402",1155,""
"15403",1155,"All the same, he said thoughtfully, Mr. Brown hasnt got wings. I"
"15404",1155,"dont see how he got in and out."
"15405",1155,""
"15406",1155,"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic"
"15407",1155,"influence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?"
"15408",1155,""
"15409",1155,"Tommy looked at him with respect."
"15410",1155,""
"15411",1155,"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it"
"15412",1155,"leaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think"
"15413",1155,"the gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and"
"15414",1155,"exits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the"
"15415",1155,"mystery dawns on them. Lets go round to the scene of the crime. I wish"
"15416",1155,"we could get hold of Tuppence. The _Ritz_ would enjoy the spectacle of"
"15417",1155,"the glad reunion."
"15418",1155,""
"15419",1155,"Inquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet"

"15422",1155,"All the same, I guess Ill have a look round upstairs, said Julius."
"15423",1155,"She might be in my sitting-room. He disappeared."
"15424",1155,""
"15425",1155,"Suddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommys elbow:"
"15426",1155,""
"15427",1155,"The young lady--shes gone away by train, I think, sir, he murmured"
"15428",1155,"shyly."
"15429",1155,""
"15430",1155,"What? Tommy wheeled round upon him."
"15431",1155,""
"15432",1155,"The small boy became pinker than before."
"15433",1155,""
"15434",1155,"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look"
"15435",1155,"sharp."
"15436",1155,""
"15437",1155,"Tommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the"
"15438",1155,"small boy proceeded. So I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a"
"15439",1155,"Bradshaw."
"15440",1155,""
"15441",1155,"Tommy interrupted him:"
"15442",1155,""
"15443",1155,"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?"
"15444",1155,""
"15445",1155,"When I took her the telegram, sir."
"15446",1155,""
"15447",1155,"A telegram?"
"15448",1155,""
"15449",1155,"Yes, sir."
"15450",1155,""
"15451",1155,"When was that?"
"15452",1155,""
"15453",1155,"About half-past twelve, sir."
"15454",1155,""
"15455",1155,"Tell me exactly what happened."
"15456",1155,""
"15457",1155,"The small boy drew a long breath."
"15458",1155,""
"15459",1155,"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened it"
"15460",1155,"and gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: Bring me up a"
"15461",1155,"Bradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry. My name isnt Henry,"
"15462",1155,"but----"
"15463",1155,""
"15464",1155,"Never mind your name, said Tommy impatiently. Go on."
"15465",1155,""
"15466",1155,"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up"
"15467",1155,"something. And then she looks up at the clock, and Hurry up, she says."
"15468",1155,"Tell them to get me a taxi, and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in"
"15469",1155,"front of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I"
"15470",1155,"was, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard"
"15471",1155,"her call out what I told you."
"15472",1155,""
"15473",1155,"The small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to"
"15474",1155,"stare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter"
"15475",1155,"in his hand."
"15476",1155,""
"15477",1155,"I say, Hersheimmer--Tommy turned to him--Tuppence has gone off"
"15478",1155,"sleuthing on her own."
"15479",1155,""
"15480",1155,"Shucks!"
"15481",1155,""
"15482",1155,"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the deuce of a"
"15483",1155,"hurry after getting a telegram. His eye fell on the letter in Juliuss"
"15484",1155,"hand. Oh; she left a note for you. Thats all right. Wheres she off"
"15485",1155,"to?"
"15486",1155,""
"15487",1155,"Almost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but"
"15488",1155,"Julius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a trifle"
"15489",1155,"embarrassed."
"15490",1155,""
"15491",1155,"I guess this is nothing to do with it. Its about something"
"15492",1155,"else--something I asked her that she was to let me know about."
"15493",1155,""
"15494",1155,"Oh! Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more."
"15495",1155,""
"15496",1155,"See here, said Julius suddenly, Id better put you wise. I asked Miss"
"15497",1155,"Tuppence to marry me this morning."
"15498",1155,""
"15499",1155,"Oh! said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Juliuss words were"
"15500",1155,"totally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain."
"15501",1155,""
"15502",1155,"Id like to tell you, continued Julius, that before I suggested"
"15503",1155,"anything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didnt"
"15504",1155,"want to butt in in any way between her and you----"
"15505",1155,""
"15506",1155,"Tommy roused himself."
"15507",1155,""
"15508",1155,"Thats all right, he said quickly. Tuppence and I have been pals for"
"15509",1155,"years. Nothing more. He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever"
"15510",1155,"so little. Thats quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was"
"15511",1155,"looking out for----"
"15512",1155,""
"15513",1155,"He stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way"
"15514",1155,"discomposed."
"15515",1155,""
"15516",1155,"Oh, I guess itll be the dollars thatll do the trick. Miss Tuppence"
"15517",1155,"put me wise to that right away. Theres no humbug about her. We ought to"
"15518",1155,"gee along together very well."
"15519",1155,""
"15520",1155,"Tommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about"
"15521",1155,"to speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius!"
"15522",1155,"Well, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men?"
"15523",1155,"Had she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she"
"15524",1155,"ever had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire"
"15525",1155,"had given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail"
"15526",1155,"herself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame"
"15527",1155,"her because she had been true to her creed?"
"15528",1155,""
"15529",1155,"Nevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and"
"15530",1155,"utterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to _say_ things"
"15531",1155,"like that--but a _real_ girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was"
"15532",1155,"utterly cold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never"
"15533",1155,"saw her again! And it was a rotten world!"
"15534",1155,""
"15535",1155,"Juliuss voice broke in on these meditations."
"15536",1155,""
"15537",1155,"Yes, we ought to gee along together very well. Ive heard that a girl"
"15538",1155,"always refuses you once--a sort of convention."
"15539",1155,""
"15540",1155,"Tommy caught his arm."
"15541",1155,""
"15542",1155,"Refuses? Did you say _refuses?_"
"15543",1155,""
"15544",1155,"Sure thing. Didnt I tell you that? She just rapped out a no without"
"15545",1155,"any kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, Ive"
"15546",1155,"heard. But shell come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her"

"15550",1155,""
"15551",1155,"What did she say in that note? he demanded fiercely."
"15552",1155,""
"15553",1155,"The obliging Julius handed it to him."
"15554",1155,""
"15555",1155,"Theres no earthly clue in it as to where shes gone, he assured"
"15556",1155,"Tommy. But you might as well see for yourself if you dont believe me."
"15557",1155,""
"15558",1155,"The note, in Tuppences well-known schoolboy writing, ran as follows:"
"15559",1155,""
"15560",1155,"DEAR JULIUS,"
"15561",1155,""
"15562",1155,"Its always better to have things in black and white. I dont feel I"
"15563",1155,"can be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Lets leave"
"15564",1155,"it till then."

"15568",1155,"TUPPENCE."
"15569",1155,""
"15570",1155,"Tommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had undergone a"
"15571",1155,"sharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and"
"15572",1155,"disinterested. Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the"
"15573",1155,"note betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that. It read"
"15574",1155,"almost like a bribe to Julius to spur him on in his efforts to find"
"15575",1155,"Tommy, but he supposed she had not really meant it that way. Darling"
"15576",1155,"Tuppence, there was not a girl in the world to touch her! When he saw"
"15577",1155,"her----His thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk."
"15578",1155,""
"15579",1155,"As you say, he remarked, pulling himself together, theres not a hint"
"15580",1155,"here as to what shes up to. Hi--Henry!"
"15581",1155,""
"15582",1155,"The small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings."
"15583",1155,""
"15584",1155,"One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with the"
"15585",1155,"telegram?"
"15586",1155,""
"15587",1155,"Henry gasped and spoke."
"15588",1155,""
"15589",1155,"She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and made a"
"15590",1155,"sort of noise like Whoop! sir."
"15591",1155,""
"15592",1155,"Very graphic, Henry, said Tommy. Heres your five shillings. Come on,"
"15593",1155,"Julius. We must find that telegram."
"15594",1155,""
"15595",1155,"They hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door. The room"
"15596",1155,"was as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange"
"15597",1155,"and white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram."
"15598",1155,""
"15599",1155,"Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great developments--TOMMY."
"15600",1155,""
"15601",1155,"They looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:"
"15602",1155,""
"15603",1155,"You didnt send it?"
"15604",1155,""
"15605",1155,"Of course not. What does it mean?"
"15606",1155,""
"15607",1155,"I guess it means the worst, said Julius quietly. Theyve got her."
"15608",1155,""
"15609",1155,"_What?_"
"15610",1155,""
"15611",1155,"Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap like a"
"15612",1155,"lamb."
"15613",1155,""
"15614",1155,"My God! What shall we do?"
"15615",1155,""
"15616",1155,"Get busy, and go after her! Right now! Theres no time to waste. Its"
"15617",1155,"almighty luck that she didnt take the wire with her. If she had wed"
"15618",1155,"probably never have traced her. But weve got to hustle. Wheres that"
"15619",1155,"Bradshaw?"
"15620",1155,""
"15621",1155,"The energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy would"
"15622",1155,"probably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before"

"15624",1155,"hustling was inevitable."
"15625",1155,""
"15626",1155,"After a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as"
"15627",1155,"being more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour"

"15630",1155,"Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From Kings Cross. Or St. Pancras. (Boy must"

"15632",1155,"thats the train she went by. 2.10, thats gone. 3.20 is the next--and a"
"15633",1155,"damned slow train too."

"15635",1155,"What about the car?"

"15637",1155,"Tommy shook his head."

"15642",1155,"Julius groaned."
"15643",1155,""
"15644",1155,"Thats so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in"
"15645",1155,"danger!"
"15646",1155,""
"15647",1155,"Tommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two, he said:"
"15648",1155,""
"15649",1155,"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?"
"15650",1155,""
"15651",1155,"Eh? I dont get you?"
"15652",1155,""
"15653",1155,"What I mean is that I dont think its their game to do her any harm,"
"15654",1155," explained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental"
"15655",1155,"processes. Shes a hostage, thats what she is. Shes in no immediate"
"15656",1155,"danger, because if we tumble on to anything, shed be damned useful to"
"15657",1155,"them. As long as theyve got her, theyve got the whip hand of us. See?"
"15658",1155,""
"15659",1155,"Sure thing, said Julius thoughtfully. Thats so."
"15660",1155,""
"15661",1155,"Besides, added Tommy, as an afterthought, Ive great faith in"
"15662",1155,"Tuppence."
"15663",1155,""
"15664",1155,"The journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded carriages. They"
"15665",1155,"had to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a small junction. Ebury"
"15666",1155,"was a deserted station with a solitary porter, to whom Tommy addressed"
"15667",1155,"himself:"
"15668",1155,""
"15669",1155,"Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?"
"15670",1155,""
"15671",1155,"The Moat House? Its a tidy step from here. The big house near the sea,"
"15672",1155,"you mean?"
"15673",1155,""
"15674",1155,"Tommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porters meticulous"
"15675",1155,"but perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station. It was"
"15676",1155,"beginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they"
"15677",1155,"trudged through the slush of the road. Suddenly Tommy halted."
"15678",1155,""
"15679",1155,"Wait a moment. He ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew."
"15680",1155,""
"15681",1155,"Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier"
"15682",1155,"train, the 12.50 from London? Shed probably ask you the way to the Moat"
"15683",1155,"House."
"15684",1155,""
"15685",1155,"He described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook his"
"15686",1155,"head. Several people had arrived by the train in question. He could not"
"15687",1155,"call to mind one young lady in particular. But he was quite certain that"
"15688",1155,"no one had asked him the way to the Moat House."
"15689",1155,""
"15690",1155,"Tommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on him"
"15691",1155,"like a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was going to"
"15692",1155,"be unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours start. Three hours was"
"15693",1155,"more than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not ignore the possibility of"
"15694",1155,"the telegram having been found."
"15695",1155,""
"15696",1155,"The way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and went nearly"
"15697",1155,"half a mile out of their direction. It was past seven oclock when a"
"15698",1155,"small boy told them that t Moat House was just past the next corner."
"15699",1155,""
"15700",1155,"A rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown drive"
"15701",1155,"thick with leaves. There was something about the place that struck a"
"15702",1155,"chill to both their hearts. They went up the deserted drive. The leaves"
"15703",1155,"deadened their footsteps. The daylight was almost gone. It was like"
"15704",1155,"walking in a world of ghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked"
"15705",1155,"with a mournful note. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down,"
"15706",1155,"startling them with its cold touch on their cheek."
"15707",1155,""
"15708",1155,"A turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That, too,"
"15709",1155,"seemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the steps up to"
"15710",1155,"the door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this desolate spot"
"15711",1155,"that Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to believe that a human"
"15712",1155,"footstep had passed this way for months."
"15713",1155,""
"15714",1155,"Julius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang discordantly,"
"15715",1155,"echoing through the emptiness within. No one came. They rang again and"
"15716",1155,"again--but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round"
"15717",1155,"the house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could"
"15718",1155,"believe the evidence of their eyes the place was empty."
"15719",1155,""
"15720",1155,"Nothing doing, said Julius."
"15721",1155,""
"15722",1155,"They retraced their steps slowly to the gate."
"15723",1155,""
"15724",1155,"There must be a village handy, continued the young American. Wed"
"15725",1155,"better make inquiries there. Theyll know something about the place, and"
"15726",1155,"whether theres been anyone there lately."
"15727",1155,""
"15728",1155,"Yes, thats not a bad idea."
"15729",1155,""
"15730",1155,"Proceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the"
"15731",1155,"outskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools, and Tommy"
"15732",1155,"stopped him with a question."
"15733",1155,""
"15734",1155,"The Moat House? Its empty. Been empty for years. Mrs. Sweenys got the"
"15735",1155,"key if you want to go over it--next to the post office."
"15736",1155,""
"15737",1155,"Tommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was also a"
"15738",1155,"sweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of the cottage"
"15739",1155,"next to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened it. She readily"
"15740",1155,"produced the key of the Moat House."
"15741",1155,""
"15742",1155,"Though I doubt if its the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a"
"15743",1155,"terrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. Twould need a lot"
"15744",1155,"of money spent on it."
"15745",1155,""
"15746",1155,"Thanks, said Tommy cheerily. I dare say itll be a washout, but"
"15747",1155,"houses are scarce nowadays."
"15748",1155,""
"15749",1155,"That they are, declared the woman heartily. My daughter and"
"15750",1155,"son-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I dont know how"
"15751",1155,"long. Its all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me,"
"15752",1155,"sir, itll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadnt you"
"15753",1155,"better wait until to-morrow?"
"15754",1155,""
"15755",1155,"Thats all right. Well have a look around this evening, anyway. Wed"
"15756",1155,"have been here before only we lost our way. Whats the best place to"
"15757",1155,"stay at for the night round here?"
"15758",1155,""
"15759",1155,"Mrs. Sweeny looked doubtful."
"15760",1155,""
"15761",1155,"Theres the _Yorkshire Arms_, but its not much of a place for"
"15762",1155,"gentlemen like you."
"15763",1155,""
"15764",1155,"Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, youve not had a young"
"15765",1155,"lady here asking for this key to-day?"
"15766",1155,""
"15767",1155,"The woman shook her head."

"15769",1155,"No ones been over the place for a long time."
"15770",1155,""
"15771",1155,"Thanks very much."
"15772",1155,""
"15773",1155,"They retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door swung"
"15774",1155,"back on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a match and"
"15775",1155,"examined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head."
"15776",1155,""
"15777",1155,"Id swear no ones passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick. Not a sign"
"15778",1155,"of a footmark."

"15783",1155,"This gets me, said Julius. I dont believe Tuppence was ever in this"
"15784",1155,"house."

"15786",1155,"She must have been."
"15787",1155,""
"15788",1155,"Julius shook his head without replying."
"15789",1155,""
"15790",1155,"Well go over it again to-morrow, said Tommy. Perhaps well see more"
"15791",1155,"in the daylight."
"15792",1155,""
"15793",1155,"On the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly"
"15794",1155,"forced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some"
"15795",1155,"considerable time. They might have left the village altogether but for"
"15796",1155,"a fortunate discovery of Tommys. As they were retracing their steps to"
"15797",1155,"the gate, he gave a sudden cry, and stooping, picked something up from"
"15798",1155,"among the leaves, and held it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch."
"15799",1155,""
"15800",1155,"Thats Tuppences!"
"15801",1155,""
"15802",1155,"Are you sure?"
"15803",1155,""
"15804",1155,"Absolutely. Ive often seen her wear it."
"15805",1155,""
"15806",1155,"Julius drew a deep breath."
"15807",1155,""
"15808",1155,"I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway. Well make"
"15809",1155,"that pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here until we find her."
"15810",1155,"Somebody _must_ have seen her."
"15811",1155,""
"15812",1155,"Forthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately and"
"15813",1155,"together, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to Tuppences"
"15814",1155,"description had been seen in the vicinity. They were baffled--but not"
"15815",1155,"discouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly"
"15816",1155,"not remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed"
"15817",1155,"to her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed"
"15818",1155,"inquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House"
"15819",1155,"that day? Again they met with no success."
"15820",1155,""
"15821",1155,"Julius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood"
"15822",1155,"daily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on which they had set high"
"15823",1155,"hopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned out to be the property of a"
"15824",1155,"highly respectable maiden lady!"
"15825",1155,""
"15826",1155,"Each day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a hound on"
"15827",1155,"the leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed"
"15828",1155,"through the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his"
"15829",1155,"way into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to"
"15830",1155,"a searching cross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his"
"15831",1155,"methods, and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;"
"15832",1155,"but, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering Tuppences"
"15833",1155,"whereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed"
"15834",1155,"literally to have vanished into thin air."
"15835",1155,""
"15836",1155,"And another preoccupation was weighing on Tommys mind."
"15837",1155,""
"15838",1155,"Do you know how long weve been here? he asked one morning as they"
"15839",1155,"sat facing each other at breakfast. A week! Were no nearer to finding"
"15840",1155,"Tuppence, _and next Sunday is the_ 29_th!_"
"15841",1155,""
"15842",1155,"Shucks! said Julius thoughtfully. Id almost forgotten about the"
"15843",1155,"29th. Ive been thinking of nothing but Tuppence."
"15844",1155,""
"15845",1155,"So have I. At least, I hadnt forgotten about the 29th, but it didnt"
"15846",1155,"seem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence. But to-days"
"15847",1155,"the 23rd, and times getting short. If were ever going to get hold of"
"15848",1155,"her at all, we must do it before the 29th--her life wont be worth an"
"15849",1155,"hours purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then."
"15850",1155,"Im beginning to feel that weve made a big mistake in the way weve set"
"15851",1155,"about this. Weve wasted time and were no forrader."
"15852",1155,""
"15853",1155,"Im with you there. Weve been a couple of mutts, whove bitten off a"
"15854",1155,"bigger bit than they can chew. Im going to quit fooling right away!"

"15860",1155,"British police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths. Sleuths! It was a piece"
"15861",1155,"of damn-fool foolishness! Im through! Ive had enough of it. Scotland"

"15884",1155,""
"15885",1155,"Join me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS."
"15886",1155,""
"15887",1155,"At 7.30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country train."
"15888",1155,"Julius was on the platform."
"15889",1155,""
"15890",1155,"Thought youd come by this train if you werent out when my wire"
"15891",1155,"arrived."
"15892",1155,""
"15893",1155,"Tommy grasped him by the arm."
"15894",1155,""
"15895",1155,"What is it? Is Tuppence found?"
"15896",1155,""
"15897",1155,"Julius shook his head."
"15898",1155,""
"15899",1155,"No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived."
"15900",1155,""
"15901",1155,"He handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommys eyes opened as he"
"15902",1155,"read:"
"15903",1155,""
"15904",1155,"Jane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel immediately--PEEL"
"15905",1155,"EDGERTON."
"15906",1155,""
"15907",1155,"Julius took the form back and folded it up."
"15908",1155,""
"15909",1155,"Queer, he said thoughtfully. I thought that lawyer chap had quit!"
"15910",1155,""
"15911",1155,""
"15912",1155,""
"15913",1155,"CHAPTER XIX. JANE FINN"
"15914",1155,""
"15915",1155,"MY train got in half an hour ago, explained Julius, as he led the way"
"15916",1155,"out of the station. I reckoned youd come by this before I left London,"
"15917",1155,"and wired accordingly to Sir James. Hes booked rooms for us, and will"
"15918",1155,"be round to dine at eight."
"15919",1155,""
"15920",1155,"What made you think hed ceased to take any interest in the case?"
"15921",1155," asked Tommy curiously."
"15922",1155,""
"15923",1155,"What he said, replied Julius dryly. The old birds as close as an"
"15924",1155,"oyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasnt going to commit"
"15925",1155,"himself till he was sure he could deliver the goods."
"15926",1155,""
"15927",1155,"I wonder, said Tommy thoughtfully."
"15928",1155,""
"15929",1155,"Julius turned on him."
"15930",1155,""
"15931",1155,"You wonder what?"
"15932",1155,""
"15933",1155,"Whether that was his real reason."
"15934",1155,""
"15935",1155,"Sure. You bet your life it was."
"15936",1155,""
"15937",1155,"Tommy shook his head unconvinced."
"15938",1155,""
"15939",1155,"Sir James arrived punctually at eight oclock, and Julius introduced"
"15940",1155,"Tommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly."
"15941",1155,""
"15942",1155,"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have heard"
"15943",1155,"so much about you from Miss Tuppence--he smiled involuntarily--that it"
"15944",1155,"really seems as though I already know you quite well."
"15945",1155,""
"15946",1155,"Thank you, sir, said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned the"
"15947",1155,"great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism of the"
"15948",1155,"others personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally"
"15949",1155,"unlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect."
"15950",1155,"Beneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the"
"15951",1155,"other, lay the same quality of mind, keen-edged like a rapier."
"15952",1155,""
"15953",1155,"In the meantime he was conscious of Sir Jamess close scrutiny. When the"
"15954",1155,"lawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had"
"15955",1155,"read him through and through like an open book. He could not but wonder"
"15956",1155,"what the final judgment was, but there was little chance of learning"
"15957",1155,"that. Sir James took in everything, but gave out only what he chose. A"
"15958",1155,"proof of that occurred almost at once."
"15959",1155,""
"15960",1155,"Immediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a flood"
"15961",1155,"of eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the girl? Why had"
"15962",1155,"he not let them know that he was still working on the case? And so on."
"15963",1155,""
"15964",1155,"Sir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:"
"15965",1155,""
"15966",1155,"Just so, just so. Well, shes found. And thats the great thing, isnt"
"15967",1155,"it? Eh! Come now, thats the great thing?"
"15968",1155,""
"15969",1155,"Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss Tuppence and I"
"15970",1155,"thought youd quit for good and all."
"15971",1155,""
"15972",1155,"Ah! The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed operations"
"15973",1155,"on his chin. You thought that, did you? Did you really? Hm, dear me."
"15974",1155,""
"15975",1155,"But I guess I can take it we were wrong, pursued Julius."
"15976",1155,""
"15977",1155,"Well, I dont know that I should go so far as to say that. But its"
"15978",1155,"certainly fortunate for all parties that weve managed to find the young"
"15979",1155,"lady."
"15980",1155,""
"15981",1155,"But where is she? demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on another"
"15982",1155,"tack. I thought youd be sure to bring her along?"
"15983",1155,""
"15984",1155,"That would hardly be possible, said Sir James gravely."
"15985",1155,""
"15986",1155,"Why?"
"15987",1155,""
"15988",1155,"Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident, and has"
"15989",1155,"sustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to the infirmary,"
"15990",1155,"and on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn. When--ah!--I"
"15991",1155,"heard that, I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a"
"15992",1155,"doctor--a friend of mine, and wired at once for you. She relapsed into"
"15993",1155,"unconsciousness and has not spoken since."
"15994",1155,""
"15995",1155,"Shes not seriously hurt?"
"15996",1155,""
"15997",1155,"Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of view,"
"15998",1155,"absurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition. Her state is"
"15999",1155,"probably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering"
"16000",1155,"her memory."
"16001",1155,""
"16002",1155,"Its come back? cried Julius excitedly."
"16003",1155,""
"16004",1155,"Sir James tapped the table rather impatiently."
"16005",1155,""
"16006",1155,"Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her real name."
"16007",1155,"I thought you had appreciated that point."
"16008",1155,""
"16009",1155,"And you just happened to be on the spot, said Tommy. Seems quite like"
"16010",1155,"a fairy tale."
"16011",1155,""
"16012",1155,"But Sir James was far too wary to be drawn."
"16013",1155,""
"16014",1155,"Coincidences are curious things, he said dryly."
"16015",1155,""
"16016",1155,"Nevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected."
"16017",1155,"Sir Jamess presence in Manchester was not accidental. Far from"
"16018",1155,"abandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some means of his own"
"16019",1155,"successfully run the missing girl to earth. The only thing that puzzled"
"16020",1155,"Tommy was the reason for all this secrecy. He concluded that it was a"
"16021",1155,"foible of the legal mind."
"16022",1155,""
"16023",1155,"Julius was speaking."
"16024",1155,""
"16025",1155,"After dinner, he announced, I shall go right away and see Jane."
"16026",1155,""
"16027",1155,"That will be impossible, I fear, said Sir James. It is very unlikely"
"16028",1155,"they would allow her to see visitors at this time of night. I should"
"16029",1155,"suggest to-morrow morning about ten oclock."
"16030",1155,""
"16031",1155,"Julius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always stirred"
"16032",1155,"him to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful personalities."
"16033",1155,""
"16034",1155,"All the same, I reckon Ill go round there to-night and see if I cant"
"16035",1155,"ginger them up to break through their silly rules."
"16036",1155,""
"16037",1155,"It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer."
"16038",1155,""
"16039",1155,"The words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with"
"16040",1155,"a start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised"
"16041",1155,"his glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir Jamess"
"16042",1155,"defiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to"
"16043",1155,"burst into flame, but in the end Julius lowered his eyes, defeated."
"16044",1155,""
"16045",1155,"For the moment, I reckon youre the boss."
"16046",1155,""
"16047",1155,"Thank you, said the other. We will say ten oclock then? With"
"16048",1155,"consummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. I must confess, Mr."
"16049",1155,"Beresford, that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here"
"16050",1155,"this evening. The last I heard of you was that your friends were in"
"16051",1155,"grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for"
"16052",1155,"some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into"
"16053",1155,"difficulties."
"16054",1155,""
"16055",1155,"I had, sir! Tommy grinned reminiscently. I was never in a tighter"
"16056",1155,"place in my life."
"16057",1155,""
"16058",1155,"Helped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated account"
"16059",1155,"of his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he"
"16060",1155,"brought the tale to a close."
"16061",1155,""
"16062",1155,"You got yourself out of a tight place very well, he said gravely. I"
"16063",1155,"congratulate you. You displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried"
"16064",1155,"your part through well."
"16065",1155,""
"16066",1155,"Tommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise."
"16067",1155,""
"16068",1155,"I couldnt have got away but for the girl, sir."
"16069",1155,""
"16070",1155,"No. Sir James smiled a little. It was lucky for you she happened"
"16071",1155,"to--er--take a fancy to you. Tommy appeared about to protest, but Sir"
"16072",1155,"James went on. Theres no doubt about her being one of the gang, I"
"16073",1155,"suppose?"
"16074",1155,""
"16075",1155,"Im afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her there by"
"16076",1155,"force, but the way she acted didnt fit in with that. You see, she went"
"16077",1155,"back to them when she could have got away."
"16078",1155,""
"16079",1155,"Sir James nodded thoughtfully."
"16080",1155,""
"16081",1155,"What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite?"
"16082",1155,""
"16083",1155,"Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer."
"16084",1155,""
"16085",1155,"She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends spoke of"
"16086",1155,"her as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of"
"16087",1155,"calling her by her full name. And, at the moment she was crying out to"
"16088",1155,"her, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying! Curious! There are one"
"16089",1155,"or two points that strike me as being obscure--their sudden change"
"16090",1155,"of attitude towards yourself, for instance. By the way, the house was"
"16091",1155,"raided, of course?"
"16092",1155,""
"16093",1155,"Yes, sir, but theyd all cleared out."
"16094",1155,""
"16095",1155,"Naturally, said Sir James dryly."
"16096",1155,""
"16097",1155,"And not a clue left behind."
"16098",1155,""
"16099",1155,"I wonder---- The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully."
"16100",1155,""
"16101",1155,"Something in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this mans eyes have"
"16102",1155,"seen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively:"
"16103",1155,""
"16104",1155,"I wish youd been there, sir, to go over the house!"
"16105",1155,""
"16106",1155,"I wish I had, said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence."
"16107",1155,"Then he looked up. And since then? What have you been doing?"
"16108",1155,""
"16109",1155,"For a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course"
"16110",1155,"the lawyer did not know."
"16111",1155,""
"16112",1155,"I forgot that you didnt know about Tuppence, he said slowly. The"
"16113",1155,"sickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing"
"16114",1155,"Jane Finn was found at last, swept over him again."
"16115",1155,""
"16116",1155,"The lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply."
"16117",1155,""
"16118",1155,"Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence? His voice was keen-edged."
"16119",1155,""
"16120",1155,"Shes disappeared, said Julius."
"16121",1155,""
"16122",1155,"When?"
"16123",1155,""
"16124",1155,"A week ago."
"16125",1155,""
"16126",1155,"How?"
"16127",1155,""
"16128",1155,"Sir Jamess questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and Julius"
"16129",1155,"gave the history of the last week and their futile search."
"16130",1155,""
"16131",1155,"Sir James went at once to the root of the matter."
"16132",1155,""
"16133",1155,"A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for that."
"16134",1155,"They werent sure of how much you had learnt in that house. Their"
"16135",1155,"kidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If"
"16136",1155,"necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen"
"16137",1155,"to her."
"16138",1155,""
"16139",1155,"Tommy nodded."
"16140",1155,""
"16141",1155,"Thats just what I thought, sir."
"16142",1155,""
"16143",1155,"Sir James looked at him keenly. You had worked that out, had you? Not"
"16144",1155,"bad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they certainly did not"
"16145",1155,"know anything about you when they first held you prisoner. You are sure"
"16146",1155,"that you did not in any way disclose your identity?"
"16147",1155,""
"16148",1155,"Tommy shook his head."
"16149",1155,""
"16150",1155,"Thats so, said Julius with a nod. Therefore I reckon some one put"
"16151",1155,"them wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon."
"16152",1155,""
"16153",1155,"Yes, but who?"
"16154",1155,""
"16155",1155,"That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!"
"16156",1155,""
"16157",1155,"There was a faint note of derision in the Americans voice which made"
"16158",1155,"Sir James look up sharply."
"16159",1155,""
"16160",1155,"You dont believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?"
"16161",1155,""
"16162",1155,"No, sir, I do not, returned the young American with emphasis. Not"
"16163",1155,"as such, that is to say. I reckon it out that hes a figurehead--just a"
"16164",1155,"bogy name to frighten the children with. The real head of this business"
"16165",1155,"is that Russian chap Kramenin. I guess hes quite capable of running"
"16166",1155,"revolutions in three countries at once if he chose! The man Whittington"
"16167",1155,"is probably the head of the English branch."
"16168",1155,""
"16169",1155,"I disagree with you, said Sir James shortly. Mr. Brown exists. He"
"16170",1155,"turned to Tommy. Did you happen to notice where that wire was handed"
"16171",1155,"in?"
"16172",1155,""
"16173",1155,"No, sir, Im afraid I didnt."
"16174",1155,""
"16175",1155,"Hm. Got it with you?"
"16176",1155,""
"16177",1155,"Its upstairs, sir, in my kit."
"16178",1155,""
"16179",1155,"Id like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. Youve wasted a"
"16180",1155,"week--Tommy hung his head--a day or so more is immaterial. Well deal"
"16181",1155,"with Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards, well set to work to rescue Miss"
"16182",1155,"Tuppence from bondage. I dont think shes in any immediate danger. That"
"16183",1155,"is, so long as they dont know that weve got Jane Finn, and that"
"16184",1155,"her memory has returned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You"
"16185",1155,"understand?"
"16186",1155,""
"16187",1155,"The other two assented, and, after making arrangements for meeting on"
"16188",1155,"the morrow, the great lawyer took his leave."
"16189",1155,""
"16190",1155,"At ten oclock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir"
"16191",1155,"James had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared unexcited. He"
"16192",1155,"introduced them to the doctor."
"16193",1155,""
"16194",1155,"Mr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. Hows the patient?"
"16195",1155,""
"16196",1155,"Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked this"
"16197",1155,"morning how many had been saved from the _Lusitania_. Was it in the"
"16198",1155,"papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems"
"16199",1155,"to have something on her mind, though."
"16200",1155,""
"16201",1155,"I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?"
"16202",1155,""
"16203",1155,"Certainly."
"16204",1155,""
"16205",1155,"Tommys heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor upstairs."
"16206",1155,"Jane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious, the elusive Jane"
"16207",1155,"Finn! How wildly improbable success had seemed! And here in this house,"
"16208",1155,"her memory almost miraculously restored, lay the girl who held the"
"16209",1155,"future of England in her hands. A half groan broke from Tommys lips."
"16210",1155,"If only Tuppence could have been at his side to share in the triumphant"
"16211",1155,"conclusion of their joint venture! Then he put the thought of Tuppence"
"16212",1155,"resolutely aside. His confidence in Sir James was growing. There was"
"16213",1155,"a man who would unerringly ferret out Tuppences whereabouts. In the"
"16214",1155,"meantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart. It"
"16215",1155,"seemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead ... stricken down"
"16216",1155,"by the hand of Mr. Brown?"
"16217",1155,""
"16218",1155,"In another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies. The"
"16219",1155,"doctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On the white"
"16220",1155,"bed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the whole scene"
"16221",1155,"seemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the"
"16222",1155,"effect of being beautifully staged."
"16223",1155,""
"16224",1155,"The girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes."
"16225",1155,"Sir James spoke first."
"16226",1155,""
"16227",1155,"Miss Finn, he said, this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer."
"16228",1155,""
"16229",1155,"A faint flush flitted over the girls face, as Julius stepped forward"
"16230",1155,"and took her hand."
"16231",1155,""
"16232",1155,"How do, Cousin Jane? he said lightly."
"16233",1155,""
"16234",1155,"But Tommy caught the tremor in his voice."
"16235",1155,""
"16236",1155,"Are you really Uncle Hirams son? she asked wonderingly."
"16237",1155,""
"16238",1155,"Her voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost"
"16239",1155,"thrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust"
"16240",1155,"the impression aside as impossible."
"16241",1155,""
"16242",1155,"Sure thing."
"16243",1155,""
"16244",1155,"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers, continued the girl,"
"16245",1155,"in her low soft tones. But I never thought Id meet you one day. Mother"
"16246",1155,"figured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with"
"16247",1155,"her."
"16248",1155,""
"16249",1155,"The old man was like that, admitted Julius. But I guess the new"
"16250",1155,"generations sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business."
"16251",1155,"First thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along"
"16252",1155,"and hunt you up."
"16253",1155,""
"16254",1155,"A shadow passed over the girls face."
"16255",1155,""
"16256",1155,"Theyve been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory went,"
"16257",1155,"and that there are years I shall never know about--years lost out of my"
"16258",1155,"life."
"16259",1155,""
"16260",1155,"You didnt realize that yourself?"
"16261",1155,""
"16262",1155,"The girls eyes opened wide."
"16263",1155,""
"16264",1155,"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were being"
"16265",1155,"hustled into those boats. I can see it all now. She closed her eyes"
"16266",1155,"with a shudder."
"16267",1155,""
"16268",1155,"Julius looked across at Sir James, who nodded."
"16269",1155,""
"16270",1155,"Dont worry any. It isnt worth it. Now, see here, Jane, theres"
"16271",1155,"something we want to know about. There was a man aboard that boat with"
"16272",1155,"some mighty important papers on him, and the big guns in this country"
"16273",1155,"have got a notion that he passed on the goods to you. Is that so?"
"16274",1155,""
"16275",1155,"The girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius"
"16276",1155,"understood."
"16277",1155,""
"16278",1155,"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get those"
"16279",1155,"papers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member of Parliament,"
"16280",1155,"and might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked. Its owing to him"
"16281",1155,"that weve ferreted you out at last. So you can go right ahead and tell"
"16282",1155,"us the whole story. Did Danvers give you the papers?"
"16283",1155,""
"16284",1155,"Yes. He said theyd have a better chance with me, because they would"
"16285",1155,"save the women and children first."
"16286",1155,""
"16287",1155,"Just as we thought, said Sir James."
"16288",1155,""
"16289",1155,"He said they were very important--that they might make all the"
"16290",1155,"difference to the Allies. But, if its all so long ago, and the wars"
"16291",1155,"over, what does it matter now?"
"16292",1155,""
"16293",1155,"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great hue"
"16294",1155,"and cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the whole"
"16295",1155,"caboodles started all over again--for rather different reasons. Then"
"16296",1155,"you can hand them over to us right away?"
"16297",1155,""
"16298",1155,"But I cant."
"16299",1155,""
"16300",1155,"What?"
"16301",1155,""
"16302",1155,"I havent got them."
"16303",1155,""
"16304",1155,"You--havent--got them? Julius punctuated the words with little"
"16305",1155,"pauses."
"16306",1155,""
"16307",1155,"No--I hid them."
"16308",1155,""
"16309",1155,"You _hid_ them?"
"16310",1155,""
"16311",1155,"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared"
"16312",1155,"me--badly. She put her hand to her head. Its almost the last thing I"
"16313",1155,"remember before waking up in the hospital...."
"16314",1155,""
"16315",1155,"Go on, said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. What do you"
"16316",1155,"remember?"
"16317",1155,""
"16318",1155,"She turned to him obediently."
"16319",1155,""
"16320",1155,"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I dont remember why...."
"16321",1155,""
"16322",1155,"That doesnt matter. Go on."
"16323",1155,""
"16324",1155,"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a"
"16325",1155,"car. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched when we got on"
"16326",1155,"the open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path at the side"
"16327",1155,"of the road. I told the man to wait."
"16328",1155,""
"16329",1155,"She paused, then went on. The path led to the cliff, and down to the"
"16330",1155,"sea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden flames. I"
"16331",1155,"looked round. There wasnt a soul in sight. But just level with my head"
"16332",1155,"there was a hole in the rock. It was quite small--I could only just get"
"16333",1155,"my hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from"
"16334",1155,"round my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off"
"16335",1155,"a bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so"
"16336",1155,"that youd never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I"
"16337",1155,"marked the place carefully in my own mind, so that Id find it again."
"16338",1155,"There was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world"
"16339",1155,"like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was"
"16340",1155,"waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed"
"16341",1155,"of myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man"
"16342",1155,"opposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt"
"16343",1155,"scared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the"
"16344",1155,"corridor to get a little air. I thought Id slip into another carriage."
"16345",1155,"But the woman called me back, said Id dropped something, and when I"
"16346",1155,"stooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here. She placed her hand"
"16347",1155,"to the back of her head. I dont remember anything more until I woke up"
"16348",1155,"in the hospital."
"16349",1155,""
"16350",1155,"There was a pause."
"16351",1155,""
"16352",1155,"Thank you, Miss Finn. It was Sir James who spoke. I hope we have not"
"16353",1155,"tired you?"
"16354",1155,""
"16355",1155,"Oh, thats all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I feel"
"16356",1155,"fine."
"16357",1155,""
"16358",1155,"Julius stepped forward and took her hand again."
"16359",1155,""
"16360",1155,"So long, Cousin Jane. Im going to get busy after those papers, but"
"16361",1155,"Ill be back in two shakes of a dogs tail, and Ill tote you up to"
"16362",1155,"London and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the"
"16363",1155,"States! I mean it--so hurry up and get well."
"16364",1155,""
"16365",1155,""
"16366",1155,""
"16367",1155,"CHAPTER XX. TOO LATE"
"16368",1155,""
"16369",1155,"IN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had drawn"
"16370",1155,"a watch from his pocket. The boat train to Holyhead stops at Chester at"
"16371",1155,"12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch the connection."
"16372",1155,""
"16373",1155,"Tommy looked up, puzzled."
"16374",1155,""
"16375",1155,"Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th."
"16376",1155,""
"16377",1155,"I guess its always well to get up early in the morning, said Julius,"
"16378",1155,"before the lawyer had time to reply. Well make tracks for the depot"
"16379",1155,"right away."
"16380",1155,""
"16381",1155,"A little frown had settled on Sir Jamess brow."
"16382",1155,""
"16383",1155,"I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at two"
"16384",1155,"oclock. It is unfortunate."
"16385",1155,""
"16386",1155,"The reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on the other"
"16387",1155,"hand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the"
"16388",1155,"others company."
"16389",1155,""
"16390",1155,"I guess theres nothing complicated about this deal, he remarked."
"16391",1155,"Just a game of hide-and-seek, thats all."
"16392",1155,""
"16393",1155,"I hope so, said Sir James."
"16394",1155,""
"16395",1155,"Sure thing. What else could it be?"
"16396",1155,""
"16397",1155,"You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will probably have"
"16398",1155,"learnt one lesson. Never underestimate your adversary."
"16399",1155,""
"16400",1155,"The gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect upon"
"16401",1155,"Julius."
"16402",1155,""
"16403",1155,"You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he does, Im"
"16404",1155,"ready for him. He slapped his pocket. I carry a gun. Little Willie"
"16405",1155,"here travels round with me everywhere. He produced a murderous-looking"
"16406",1155,"automatic, and tapped it affectionately before returning it to its"
"16407",1155,"home. But he wont be needed this trip. Theres nobody to put Mr. Brown"
"16408",1155,"wise."
"16409",1155,""
"16410",1155,"The lawyer shrugged his shoulders."
"16411",1155,""
"16412",1155,"There was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer"
"16413",1155,"meant to betray him. Nevertheless, _Mrs. Vandemeyer died without"
"16414",1155,"speaking_."
"16415",1155,""
"16416",1155,"Julius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter note:"
"16417",1155,""
"16418",1155,"I only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck. Take"
"16419",1155,"no unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If there is any"
"16420",1155,"reason to believe that you have been shadowed, destroy them at once."
"16421",1155,"Good luck to you. The game is in your hands now. He shook hands with"
"16422",1155,"them both."
"16423",1155,""
"16424",1155,"Ten minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class"
"16425",1155,"carriage _en route_ for Chester."
"16426",1155,""
"16427",1155,"For a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius broke the"
"16428",1155,"silence, it was with a totally unexpected remark."
"16429",1155,""
"16430",1155,"Say, he observed thoughtfully, did you ever make a darned fool of"
"16431",1155,"yourself over a girls face?"
"16432",1155,""
"16433",1155,"Tommy, after a moments astonishment, searched his mind."
"16434",1155,""
"16435",1155,"Cant say I have, he replied at last. Not that I can recollect,"
"16436",1155,"anyhow. Why?"
"16437",1155,""
"16438",1155,"Because for the last two months Ive been making a sentimental idiot of"
"16439",1155,"myself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her photograph my heart"
"16440",1155,"did all the usual stunts you read about in novels. I guess Im ashamed"
"16441",1155,"to admit it, but I came over here determined to find her and fix it all"
"16442",1155,"up, and take her back as Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!"
"16443",1155,""
"16444",1155,"Oh! said Tommy, amazed."
"16445",1155,""
"16446",1155,"Julius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:"
"16447",1155,""
"16448",1155,"Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One look at"
"16449",1155,"the girl in the flesh, and I was cured!"
"16450",1155,""
"16451",1155,"Feeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated Oh! again."
"16452",1155,""
"16453",1155,"No disparagement to Jane, mind you, continued the other. Shes a real"
"16454",1155,"nice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her right away."
"16455",1155,""
"16456",1155,"I thought her a very good-looking girl, said Tommy, finding his"
"16457",1155,"tongue."
"16458",1155,""
"16459",1155,"Sure she is. But shes not like her photo one bit. At least I suppose"
"16460",1155,"she is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right off. If Id"
"16461",1155,"seen her in a crowd Id have said Theres a girl whose face I know"
"16462",1155,"right away without any hesitation. But there was something about that"
"16463",1155,"photo--Julius shook his head, and heaved a sigh--I guess romance is a"
"16464",1155,"mighty queer thing!"
"16465",1155,""
"16466",1155,"It must be, said Tommy coldly, if you can come over here in love with"
"16467",1155,"one girl, and propose to another within a fortnight."
"16468",1155,""
"16469",1155,"Julius had the grace to look discomposed."
"16470",1155,""
"16471",1155,"Well, you see, Id got a sort of tired feeling that Id never find"
"16472",1155,"Jane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And then--oh, well,"
"16473",1155,"the French, for instance, are much more sensible in the way they look at"
"16474",1155,"things. They keep romance and marriage apart----"
"16475",1155,""
"16476",1155,"Tommy flushed."
"16477",1155,""
"16478",1155,"Well, Im damned! If thats----"
"16479",1155,""
"16480",1155,"Julius hastened to interrupt."
"16481",1155,""
"16482",1155,"Say now, dont be hasty. I dont mean what you mean. I take it"
"16483",1155,"Americans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even. What I"
"16484",1155,"meant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike way--find"
"16485",1155,"two people who are suited to one another, look after the money affairs,"
"16486",1155,"and see the whole thing practically, and in a businesslike spirit."
"16487",1155,""
"16488",1155,"If you ask me, said Tommy, were all too damned businesslike"
"16489",1155,"nowadays. Were always saying, Will it pay? The men are bad enough,"
"16490",1155,"and the girls are worse!"
"16491",1155,""
"16492",1155,"Cool down, son. Dont get so heated."
"16493",1155,""
"16494",1155,"I feel heated, said Tommy."
"16495",1155,""
"16496",1155,"Julius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more."
"16497",1155,""
"16498",1155,"However, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached"
"16499",1155,"Holyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they"
"16500",1155,"alighted at their destination."
"16501",1155,""
"16502",1155,"After consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were fairly"
"16503",1155,"well agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi without more"
"16504",1155,"ado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay. They instructed"
"16505",1155,"the man to go slowly, and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path."
"16506",1155,"They came to it not long after leaving the town, and Tommy stopped the"
"16507",1155,"car promptly, asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the"
"16508",1155,"sea, and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style."
"16509",1155,""
"16510",1155,"A moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead. Tommy and"
"16511",1155,"Julius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the narrow path."
"16512",1155,""
"16513",1155,"Its the right one, I suppose? asked Tommy doubtfully. There must be"
"16514",1155,"simply heaps along here."
"16515",1155,""
"16516",1155,"Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?"
"16517",1155,""
"16518",1155,"Tommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the"
"16519",1155,"path on either side, and was convinced."
"16520",1155,""
"16521",1155,"They went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy turned his"
"16522",1155,"head uneasily. Julius looked back."
"16523",1155,""
"16524",1155,"What is it?"
"16525",1155,""
"16526",1155,"I dont know. Ive got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying theres some"
"16527",1155,"one following us."
"16528",1155,""
"16529",1155,"Cant be, said Julius positively. Wed see him."
"16530",1155,""
"16531",1155,"Tommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense of"
"16532",1155,"uneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience"
"16533",1155,"of the enemy."
"16534",1155,""
"16535",1155,"I rather wish that fellow would come along, said Julius. He patted his"
"16536",1155,"pocket. Little William here is just aching for exercise!"
"16537",1155,""
"16538",1155,"Do you always carry it--him--with you? inquired Tommy with burning"
"16539",1155,"curiosity."
"16540",1155,""
"16541",1155,"Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up."
"16542",1155,""
"16543",1155,"Tommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little William. It"
"16544",1155,"seemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away."
"16545",1155,""
"16546",1155,"The path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to the"
"16547",1155,"sea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned"
"16548",1155,"into him."
"16549",1155,""
"16550",1155,"Whats up? he inquired."
"16551",1155,""
"16552",1155,"Look there. If that doesnt beat the band!"
"16553",1155,""
"16554",1155,"Tommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder"
"16555",1155,"which certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a begging terrier."

"16557",1155,"Well, said Tommy, refusing to share Juliuss emotion, its what we"
"16558",1155,"expected to see, isnt it?"
"16559",1155,""
"16560",1155,"Julius looked at him sadly and shook his head."

"16562",1155,"British phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me, all the"
"16563",1155,"same, to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it!"
"16564",1155,""
"16565",1155,"Tommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved his"
"16566",1155,"feet impatiently."
"16567",1155,""
"16568",1155,"Push on. What about the hole?"
"16569",1155,""
"16570",1155,"They scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying"
"16571",1155,"idiotically:"
"16572",1155,""
"16573",1155,"The gorse wont be there after all these years."
"16574",1155,""
"16575",1155,"And Julius replied solemnly:"

"16579",1155,"Tommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand."

"16581",1155,"What about that crevice there?"

"16583",1155,"Julius replied in an awestricken voice:"

"16585",1155,"Thats it--for sure."

"16587",1155,"They looked at each other."
"16588",1155,""
"16589",1155,"When I was in France, said Tommy reminiscently, whenever my batman"
"16590",1155,"failed to call me, he always said that he had come over queer. I never"
"16591",1155,"believed it. But whether he felt it or not, there _is_ such a sensation."
"16592",1155,"Ive got it now! Badly!"
"16593",1155,""
"16594",1155,"He looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion."

"16596",1155,"Damn it! he cried. Its impossible! Five years! Think of it!"
"16597",1155,"Birds-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people passing! It"
"16598",1155,"cant be there! Its a hundred to one against its being there! Its"
"16599",1155,"against all reason!"
"16600",1155,""
"16601",1155,"Indeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he could not"
"16602",1155,"believe in his own success where so many others had failed. The thing"
"16603",1155,"was too easy, therefore it could not be. The hole would be empty."
"16604",1155,""
"16605",1155,"Julius looked at him with a widening smile."
"16606",1155,""
"16607",1155,"I guess youre rattled now all right, he drawled with some enjoyment."
"16608",1155,"Well, here goes! He thrust his hand into the crevice, and made a"
"16609",1155,"slight grimace. Its a tight fit. Janes hand must be a few sizes"
"16610",1155,"smaller than mine. I dont feel anything--no--say, whats this? Gee"
"16611",1155,"whiz! And with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet."
"16612",1155,"Its the goods all right. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my"
"16613",1155,"penknife."
"16614",1155,""

"16616",1155,"between his hands. They had succeeded!"
"16617",1155,""
"16618",1155,"Its queer, he murmured idly, youd think the stitches would have"
"16619",1155,"rotted. They look just as good as new."
"16620",1155,""
"16621",1155,"They cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was a small"
"16622",1155,"folded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they unfolded it. The"
"16623",1155,"sheet was blank! They stared at each other, puzzled."
"16624",1155,""
"16625",1155,"A dummy? hazarded Julius. Was Danvers just a decoy?"

"16637",1155,"In a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing"

"16665",1155,"Tommy shook his head, and said dully:"

"16667",1155,"It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have guessed...."
"16668",1155,""
"16669",1155,"Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We hustled"
"16670",1155,"all we knew. Its downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker"
"16671",1155,"than we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a"
"16672",1155,"dictaphone in Janes room? I guess there must have been."

"16686",1155,"Sure thing they would! No, some ones got ahead of us to-day by an hour"

"16695",1155,"illogical idea that the K.C.s presence would somehow have averted the"
"16696",1155,"catastrophe. He reverted to his former point of view. Its no good"
"16697",1155,"arguing about how it was done. The games up. Weve failed. Theres only"
"16698",1155,"one thing for me to do."

"16700",1155,"Whats that?"
"16701",1155,""
"16702",1155,"Get back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be warned. Its"

"16705",1155,""
"16706",1155,"The duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of shirking"
"16707",1155,"it. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After that his work was"

"16722",1155,"Ah! said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did not"
"16723",1155,"change, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes. It"
"16724",1155,"convinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless."

"16755",1155,"The typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of a green"
"16756",1155,"toque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C. He looked"

"16780",1155,"Im taking up your time, sir, he said with an effort. Theres no need"

"16785",1155,"Back at the _Ritz_, Tommy packed up his few belongings mechanically,"
"16786",1155,"his thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by the introduction of"

"17066",1155,"good. He can use his brains, that young fellow. I congratulated him. The"

"17251",1155,"his theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th. The 29th was the"
"17252",1155,"much-talked-of Labour Day, about which all sorts of rumours were"
"17253",1155,"running riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a"
"17254",1155,"Labour _coup dtat_ were freely reported. The Government said nothing."
"17255",1155,"It knew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the"
"17256",1155,"Labour leaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among"
"17257",1155,"them realized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the"
"17258",1155,"England that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and"
"17259",1155,"misery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet the"
"17260",1155,"Government half-way. But behind them were subtle, insistent forces at"
"17261",1155,"work, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating the weakness of"
"17262",1155,"half-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings."
"17263",1155,""
"17264",1155,"Tommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position fairly"
"17265",1155,"accurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown,"
"17266",1155,"public opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and"
"17267",1155,"revolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance. The"
"17268",1155,"Government with a loyal army and police force behind them might"
"17269",1155,"win--but at a cost of great suffering. But Tommy nourished another and"
"17270",1155,"a preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he"
"17271",1155,"believed, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization would crumble"
"17272",1155,"ignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating influence"
"17273",1155,"of the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an"
"17274",1155,"instant panic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an"
"17275",1155,"eleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible."
"17276",1155,""
"17277",1155,"This is a one-man show, said Tommy to himself. The thing to do is to"
"17278",1155,"get hold of the man."

"17280",1155,"It was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had"
"17281",1155,"requested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft"
"17282",1155,"treaty was Tommys bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own"
"17283",1155,"presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many"
"17284",1155,"wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously"
"17285",1155,"to his idea."
"17286",1155,""
"17287",1155,"That evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley"

"17291",1155,"On the second floor window some one standing between the window and"

"17315",1155,"affectionately as dear old whiskers. The footman took him by one arm,"
"17316",1155,"the butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out"
"17317",1155,"of the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded"

"17949",1155,"Hurry up, she panted, or well miss it."
"17950",1155,""
"17951",1155,"They arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill."
"17952",1155,"Tuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment, and the"
"17953",1155,"two girls sank down breathless on the padded seats."
"17954",1155,""
"17955",1155,"A man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started"
"17956",1155,"nervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly at"

"17963",1155,"No, no. Its all right. She took Janes hand in hers. Tommy wouldnt"
"17964",1155,"have told us to do this unless he was sure wed be all right."
"17965",1155,""
"17966",1155,"But he doesnt know them as I do! The girl shivered. You cant"
"17967",1155,"understand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I thought I should go"
"17968",1155,"mad."

"17977",1155,"What was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the window."
"17978",1155,""
"17979",1155,"No, theres nothing. See. Tuppence went to the window, and lifting the"
"17980",1155,"strap let the pane down."

"17982",1155,"Youre sure?"
"17983",1155,""
"17984",1155,"Quite sure."

"17988",1155,"I guess Im acting like a frightened rabbit, but I cant help it. If"
"17989",1155,"they caught me now theyd---- Her eyes opened wide and staring."
"17990",1155,""
"17991",1155,"_Dont!_ implored Tuppence. Lie back, and _dont think_. You can be"
"17992",1155,"quite sure that Tommy wouldnt have said it was safe if it wasnt."

"17996",1155,"No, said Tuppence, rather embarrassed."

"18002",1155,"Your voice was so--queer!"

"18004",1155,"I _was_ thinking of something, confessed Tuppence. But I dont want"
"18005",1155,"to tell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I dont think so. Its just"
"18006",1155,"an idea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommys got it too--Im"
"18007",1155,"almost sure he has. But dont _you_ worry--therell be time enough for"
"18008",1155,"that later. And it maynt be so at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and"

"18013",1155,"Tuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of a"
"18014",1155,"watchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was nervous. Her eyes"
"18015",1155,"flashed continually from one window to the other. She noted the exact"
"18016",1155,"position of the communication cord. What it was that she feared, she"
"18017",1155,"would have been hard put to it to say. But in her own mind she was"
"18018",1155,"far from feeling the confidence displayed in her words. Not that she"
"18019",1155,"disbelieved in Tommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to"
"18020",1155,"whether anyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for"
"18021",1155,"the fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal."

"18023",1155,"If they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would be"
"18024",1155,"well. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces of Mr. Brown"
"18025",1155,"already be assembling against them? Even that last picture of Tommy,"
"18026",1155,"revolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By now he might be overpowered,"
"18027",1155,"borne down by sheer force of numbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of"

"18035",1155,"Oh, I thought wed get to London all right. If theres going to be any"

"18037",1155,""
"18038",1155,"In another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the necessary"
"18039",1155,"fares, and were stepping into a taxi."
"18040",1155,""
"18041",1155,"Kings Cross, directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man looked in"
"18042",1155,"at the window, just as they started. She was almost certain it was the"
"18043",1155,"same man who had got into the carriage next to them. She had a horrible"
"18044",1155,"feeling of being slowly hemmed in on every side."
"18045",1155,""
"18046",1155,"You see, she explained to Jane, if they think were going to Sir"
"18047",1155,"James, this will put them off the scent. Now theyll imagine were going"
"18048",1155,"to Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London somewhere."

"18053",1155,"Quick, she whispered. Open the right-hand door!"
"18054",1155,""
"18055",1155,"The two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later they were"
"18056",1155,"seated in another taxi and were retracing their steps, this time direct"
"18057",1155,"to Carlton House Terrace."
"18058",1155,""
"18059",1155,"There, said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, this ought to do them."
"18060",1155,"I cant help thinking that Im really rather clever! How that other taxi"
"18061",1155,"man will swear! But I took his number, and Ill send him a postal order"
"18062",1155,"to-morrow, so that he wont lose by it if he happens to be genuine."
"18063",1155,"Whats this thing swerving----Oh!"
"18064",1155,""
"18065",1155,"There was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided with"
"18066",1155,"them."
"18067",1155,""
"18068",1155,"In a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was"
"18069",1155,"approaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver five"
"18070",1155,"shillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the crowd."
"18071",1155,""
"18072",1155,"Its only a step or two now, said Tuppence breathlessly. The accident"
"18073",1155,"had taken place in Trafalgar Square."
"18074",1155,""
"18075",1155,"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done deliberately?"
"18076",1155,""
"18077",1155,"I dont know. It might have been either."
"18078",1155,""
"18079",1155,"Hand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along."
"18080",1155,""
"18081",1155,"It may be my fancy, said Tuppence suddenly, but I feel as though"
"18082",1155,"there was some one behind us."
"18083",1155,""
"18084",1155,"Hurry! murmured the other. Oh, hurry!"
"18085",1155,""
"18086",1155,"They were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their spirits"
"18087",1155,"lightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated man barred their"
"18088",1155,"way."
"18089",1155,""
"18090",1155,"Good evening, ladies, he hiccupped. Whither away so fast?"
"18091",1155,""
"18092",1155,"Let us pass, please, said Tuppence imperiously."
"18093",1155,""
"18094",1155,"Just a word with your pretty friend here. He stretched out an unsteady"
"18095",1155,"hand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard other footsteps"
"18096",1155,"behind. She did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or"
"18097",1155,"foes. Lowering her head, she repeated a manuvre of childish days,"
"18098",1155,"and butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle. The success of"
"18099",1155,"these unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly"
"18100",1155,"on the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they"
"18101",1155,"sought was some way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their"
"18102",1155,"breath was coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir Jamess door."
"18103",1155,"Tuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker."
"18104",1155,""
"18105",1155,"The man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a moment"
"18106",1155,"he hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell into the hall"
"18107",1155,"together. Sir James came forward from the library door."
"18108",1155,""
"18109",1155,"Hullo! Whats this?"
"18110",1155,""
"18111",1155,"He stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed"
"18112",1155,"uncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her on the"
"18113",1155,"leather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out a few drops of"
"18114",1155,"brandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh she sat up, her eyes"
"18115",1155,"still wild and frightened."
"18116",1155,""
"18117",1155,"Its all right. Dont be afraid, my child. Youre quite safe."
"18118",1155,""
"18119",1155,"Her breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her"
"18120",1155,"cheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically."
"18121",1155,""
"18122",1155,"So youre not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of"
"18123",1155,"yours was!"
"18124",1155,""
"18125",1155,"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing, boasted Tuppence."
"18126",1155,""
"18127",1155,"So it seems, said Sir James dryly. Am I right in thinking that the"
"18128",1155,"joint venture has ended in success, and that this--he turned to the"
"18129",1155,"girl on the couch--is Miss Jane Finn?"
"18130",1155,""
"18131",1155,"Jane sat up."
"18132",1155,""
"18133",1155,"Yes, she said quietly, I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell you."

"18135",1155,"When you are stronger----"
"18136",1155,""
"18137",1155,"No--now! Her voice rose a little. I shall feel safer when I have told"
"18138",1155,"everything."
"18139",1155,""
"18140",1155,"As you please, said the lawyer."
"18141",1155,""
"18142",1155,"He sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a low"
"18143",1155,"voice Jane began her story."
"18144",1155,""
"18145",1155,"I came over on the _Lusitania_ to take up a post in Paris. I was"
"18146",1155,"fearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or other. I"
"18147",1155,"had been studying French, and my teacher said they were wanting help in"
"18148",1155,"a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my services, and they were"
"18149",1155,"accepted. I hadnt got any folk of my own, so it made it easy to arrange"
"18150",1155,"things."
"18151",1155,""
"18152",1155,"When the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed, a man came up to me. Id noticed"
"18153",1155,"him more than once--and Id figured it out in my own mind that he"
"18154",1155,"was afraid of somebody or something. He asked me if I was a patriotic"
"18155",1155,"American, and told me he was carrying papers which were just life or"
"18156",1155,"death to the Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch"
"18157",1155,"for an advertisement in the _Times_. If it didnt appear, I was to take"
"18158",1155,"them to the American Ambassador."
"18159",1155,""
"18160",1155,"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in my"
"18161",1155,"dreams sometimes.... Ill hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me"
"18162",1155,"to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didnt"
"18163",1155,"think so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I"
"18164",1155,"began to get uneasy. There was one woman who had been very keen to look"
"18165",1155,"after me, and chum up with me generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first Id"
"18166",1155,"been only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I"
"18167",1155,"felt there was something about her I didnt like, and on the Irish"
"18168",1155,"boat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they"
"18169",1155,"looked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that shed"
"18170",1155,"been quite near me on the _Lusitania_ when Mr. Danvers gave me the"
"18171",1155,"packet, and before that shed tried to talk to him once or twice. I"
"18172",1155,"began to get scared, but I didnt quite see what to do."
"18173",1155,""
"18174",1155,"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to London"
"18175",1155,"that day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness. The only"
"18176",1155,"thing was to act as though Id noticed nothing, and hope for the best."
"18177",1155,"I couldnt see how they could get me if I was on my guard. One thing"
"18178",1155,"Id done already as a precaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and"
"18179",1155,"substituted blank paper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did"
"18180",1155,"manage to rob me of it, it wouldnt matter."
"18181",1155,""
"18182",1155,"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I opened it"
"18183",1155,"out flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it between two of the"
"18184",1155,"advertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the two pages together"
"18185",1155,"round the edge with some gum off an envelope. I carried the magazine"
"18186",1155,"carelessly stuffed into the pocket of my ulster."
"18187",1155,""
"18188",1155,"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all"
"18189",1155,"right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me"
"18190",1155,"shoving and pushing me just the way I didnt want to go. There was"
"18191",1155,"something uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in"
"18192",1155,"a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor,"
"18193",1155,"but all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down."
"18194",1155,"I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the"
"18195",1155,"carriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just"
"18196",1155,"opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I"
"18197",1155,"had leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep,"
"18198",1155,"but my eyes werent quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man"
"18199",1155,"get something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he"
"18200",1155,"did so he _winked_...."
"18201",1155,""
"18202",1155,"I cant tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and through. My"
"18203",1155,"only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could. I"
"18204",1155,"got up, trying to look natural and easy. Perhaps they saw something--I"
"18205",1155,"dont know--but suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer said Now, and flung something"
"18206",1155,"over my nose and mouth as I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a"
"18207",1155,"terrific blow on the back of my head...."
"18208",1155,""
"18209",1155,"She shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In a minute"
"18210",1155,"she resumed:"
"18211",1155,""
"18212",1155,"I dont know how long it was before I came back to consciousness. I"
"18213",1155,"felt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty bed. There was a"
"18214",1155,"screen round it, but I could hear two people talking in the room. Mrs."
"18215",1155,"Vandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but at first I couldnt"
"18216",1155,"take much in. When at last I did begin to grasp what was going on--I was"
"18217",1155,"just terrified! I wonder I didnt scream right out there and then."
"18218",1155,""
"18219",1155,"They hadnt found the papers. Theyd got the oilskin packet with the"
"18220",1155,"blanks, and they were just mad! They didnt know whether _I_d changed"
"18221",1155,"the papers, or whether Danvers had been carrying a dummy message,"
"18222",1155,"while the real one was sent another way. They spoke of--she closed her"
"18223",1155,"eyes--torturing me to find out!"
"18224",1155,""
"18225",1155,"Id never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before! Once"
"18226",1155,"they came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be still"
"18227",1155,"unconscious, but I was afraid theyd hear the beating of my heart."
"18228",1155,"However, they went away again. I began thinking madly. What could I do?"
"18229",1155,"I knew I wouldnt be able to stand up against torture very long."
"18230",1155,""
"18231",1155,"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my head. The"
"18232",1155,"subject had always interested me, and Id read an awful lot about it."
"18233",1155,"I had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I could succeed in"
"18234",1155,"carrying the bluff through, it might save me. I said a prayer, and drew"
"18235",1155,"a long breath. Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in _French!_"
"18236",1155,""
"18237",1155,"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so wicked I"
"18238",1155,"nearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and asked her in French"
"18239",1155,"where I was."
"18240",1155,""
"18241",1155,"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been talking"
"18242",1155,"to. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in"
"18243",1155,"French. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I dont know"
"18244",1155,"why, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt hed seen right through"
"18245",1155,"me, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and"
"18246",1155,"then went on that there was something I _must_ remember--_must_"
"18247",1155,"remember--only for the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to"
"18248",1155,"be more and more distressed. He asked me my name. I said I didnt"
"18249",1155,"know--that I couldnt remember anything at all."
"18250",1155,""
"18251",1155,"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful."
"18252",1155,"I screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek"
"18253",1155,"out things in French. I dont know how long I could have gone on, but"
"18254",1155,"luckily I fainted. The last thing I heard was his voice saying: Thats"
"18255",1155,"not bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldnt know enough. I guess he"
"18256",1155,"forgot American girls are older for their age than English ones, and"

"18261",1155,"and been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended to be rather"
"18262",1155,"dazed--murmured something about the doctor having hurt my wrist. She"

"18269",1155,"the circumstances. It was a squalid, dirty place. There were no windows,"
"18270",1155,"which seemed queer. I guessed the door would be locked, but I didnt"

"18298",1155,"get hold of it, it went again. Then she told me that I was her niece,"
"18299",1155,"and that I was to call her Aunt Rita. I did obediently, and she told"

"18373",1155,"Paris. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that"
"18374",1155,"seemed to show that other people--friends--were looking for me. I"
"18375",1155,"learnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris,"
"18376",1155,"and consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her"
"18377",1155,"through some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be"
"18378",1155,"fraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced"
"18379",1155,"them on me. I dare say I couldnt have deceived the specialist for a"

"18565",1155,"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he was too"
"18566",1155,"sharp for them. All the same, Im not too easy in my mind about him."
"18567",1155,""
"18568",1155,"Why?"
"18569",1155,""
"18570",1155,"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown, said Sir James dryly. And it"
"18571",1155,"takes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown...."
"18572",1155,""
"18573",1155,"Tuppence paled a little."
"18574",1155,""
"18575",1155,"What can we do?"
"18576",1155,""
"18577",1155,"Nothing until weve been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still"
"18578",1155,"got the upper hand, theres nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy"
"18579",1155,"will come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared! From a drawer"
"18580",1155,"in the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat"
"18581",1155,"pocket."
"18582",1155,""
"18583",1155,"Now were ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you,"
"18584",1155,"Miss Tuppence----"
"18585",1155,""
"18586",1155,"I should think so indeed!"
"18587",1155,""
"18588",1155,"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be"
"18589",1155,"perfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she"
"18590",1155,"has been through."
"18591",1155,""
"18592",1155,"But to Tuppences surprise Jane shook her head."
"18593",1155,""
"18594",1155,"No. I guess Im going too. Those papers were my trust. I must go"
"18595",1155,"through with this business to the end. Im heaps better now anyway."
"18596",1155,""
"18597",1155,"Sir Jamess car was ordered round. During the short drive Tuppences"
"18598",1155,"heart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms of uneasiness"
"18599",1155,"respecting Tommy, she could not but feel exultation. They were going to"
"18600",1155,"win!"
"18601",1155,""
"18602",1155,"The car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir James"
"18603",1155,"went up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several others, and"
"18604",1155,"spoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls."
"18605",1155,""
"18606",1155,"No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at the back"
"18607",1155,"as well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who attempts to enter"
"18608",1155,"after we have done so will be arrested immediately. Shall we go in?"
"18609",1155,""
"18610",1155,"A policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They had also"
"18611",1155,"had orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member of the party was"
"18612",1155,"unknown to them. The three entered the house, pulling the door to behind"
"18613",1155,"them. Slowly they mounted the rickety stairs. At the top was the ragged"
"18614",1155,"curtain hiding the recess where Tommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had"
"18615",1155,"heard the story from Jane in her character of Annette. She looked at"
"18616",1155,"the tattered velvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it"
"18617",1155,"moved--as though _some one_ was behind it. So strong was the illusion"
"18618",1155,"that she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form...."
"18619",1155,"Supposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting...."
"18620",1155,""
"18621",1155,"Impossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the curtain aside"
"18622",1155,"and make sure...."
"18623",1155,""
"18624",1155,"Now they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to hide"
"18625",1155,"here, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided herself"
"18626",1155,"indignantly. She must not give way to this foolish fancying--this"
"18627",1155,"curious insistent feeling that _Mr. Brown was in the house_.... Hark!"
"18628",1155,"what was that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There _was_ some one"
"18629",1155,"in the house! Absurd! She was becoming hysterical."
"18630",1155,""
"18631",1155,"Jane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it"
"18632",1155,"with a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs"
"18633",1155,"lay between it and the wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and"
"18634",1155,"she ripped away the brown paper from the back.... The advertisement"
"18635",1155,"page of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed"
"18636",1155,"inner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing!"
"18637",1155,""
"18638",1155,"No dummy this time! The real thing!"
"18639",1155,""
"18640",1155,"Weve got it, said Tuppence. At last...."
"18641",1155,""
"18642",1155,"The moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the faint"
"18643",1155,"creakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of them had eyes"
"18644",1155,"for anything but what Jane held in her hand."
"18645",1155,""
"18646",1155,"Sir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively."
"18647",1155,""
"18648",1155,"Yes, he said quietly, this is the ill-fated draft treaty!"
"18649",1155,""
"18650",1155,"Weve succeeded, said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost wondering"
"18651",1155,"unbelief in her voice."
"18652",1155,""
"18653",1155,"Sir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and put it"
"18654",1155,"away in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round the dingy room."
"18655",1155,""
"18656",1155,"It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was"
"18657",1155,"it not? he said. A truly sinister room. You notice the absence of"
"18658",1155,"windows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door. Whatever took"
"18659",1155,"place here would never be heard by the outside world."
"18660",1155,""
"18661",1155,"Tuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if there"
"18662",1155,"_was_ some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar that door"
"18663",1155,"on them, and leave them to die like rats in a trap? Then she realized"
"18664",1155,"the absurdity of her thought. The house was surrounded by police who,"
"18665",1155,"if they failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a"
"18666",1155,"thorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness--then looked up with"
"18667",1155,"a start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little"
"18668",1155,"nod."
"18669",1155,""
"18670",1155,"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does Miss"
"18671",1155,"Finn."
"18672",1155,""
"18673",1155,"Yes, admitted Jane. Its absurd--but I cant help it."
"18674",1155,""
"18675",1155,"Sir James nodded again."
"18676",1155,""
"18677",1155,"You feel--as we all feel-- _the presence of Mr. Bown_. Yes--as"
"18678",1155,"Tuppence made a movement--not a doubt of it-- _Mr. Brown is here_...."
"18679",1155,""
"18680",1155,"In this house?"
"18681",1155,""
"18682",1155,"In this room.... You dont understand? _I am Mr. Brown_...."
"18683",1155,""
"18684",1155,"Stupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of his face"
"18685",1155,"had changed. It was a different man who stood before them. He smiled a"
"18686",1155,"slow cruel smile."
"18687",1155,""
"18688",1155,"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had"
"18689",1155,"succeeded. _I_ have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine. His smile grew"
"18690",1155,"wider as he looked at Tuppence. Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner"
"18691",1155,"or later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of"
"18692",1155,"Mr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third"
"18693",1155,"will not be dead, only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack"
"18694",1155,"with a wealth of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So"
"18695",1155,"no one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!"
"18696",1155,""
"18697",1155,"He turned to Jane."
"18698",1155,""
"18699",1155,"You outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not do it"
"18700",1155,"again."
"18701",1155,""
"18702",1155,"There was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he"
"18703",1155,"did not turn his head."
"18704",1155,""
"18705",1155,"He slipped his hand into his pocket."
"18706",1155,""
"18707",1155,"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers, he said, and slowly raised the big"
"18708",1155,"automatic."
"18709",1155,""
"18710",1155,"But, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a grip of"
"18711",1155,"iron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the voice of Julius"
"18712",1155,"Hersheimmer said drawlingly:"
"18713",1155,""
"18714",1155,"I guess youre caught redhanded with the goods upon you."
"18715",1155,""
"18716",1155,"The blood rushed to the K.C.s face, but his self-control was"
"18717",1155,"marvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two captors. He"
"18718",1155,"looked longest at Tommy."
"18719",1155,""
"18720",1155,"You, he said beneath his breath. _You!_ I might have known."
"18721",1155,""
"18722",1155,"Seeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip"
"18723",1155,"slackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore the big"
"18724",1155,"signet ring, was raised to his lips...."
"18725",1155,""
"18726",1155,"_Ave, Csar! te morituri salutant_, he said, still looking at"

"18729",1155,"Then his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell"

"18737",1155,"THE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the"
"18738",1155,"evening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took"
"18739",1155,"place in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmers orders were brief and"
"18740",1155,"forcible. He gave carte blanche--and when a millionaire gives carte"
"18741",1155,"blanche he usually gets it!"
"18742",1155,""
"18743",1155,"Every delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles"
"18744",1155,"of ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral decorations"
"18745",1155,"defied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far apart as May and"
"18746",1155,"November found themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guests"
"18747",1155,"was small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken"
"18748",1155,"the liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford,"
"18749",1155,"with him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers,"
"18750",1155,"Miss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least,"
"18751",1155,"as guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn."
"18752",1155,""
"18753",1155,"Julius had spared no pains to make Janes appearance a success. A"
"18754",1155,"mysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the apartment she"
"18755",1155,"was sharing with the American girl. It was Julius. In his hand he held a"
"18756",1155,"cheque."
"18757",1155,""
"18758",1155,"Say, Tuppence, he began, will you do me a good turn? Take this, and"
"18759",1155,"get Jane regularly togged up for this evening. Youre all coming to"
"18760",1155,"supper with me at the _Savoy_. See? Spare no expense. You get me?"
"18761",1155,""
"18762",1155,"Sure thing, mimicked Tuppence. We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a"
"18763",1155,"pleasure dressing Jane. Shes the loveliest thing Ive ever seen."
"18764",1155,""
"18765",1155,"Thats so, agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently."
"18766",1155,""
"18767",1155,"His fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppences eye."

"18769",1155,"By the way, Julius, she remarked demurely, I--havent given you my"
"18770",1155,"answer yet."
"18771",1155,""
"18772",1155,"Answer? said Julius. His face paled."

"18774",1155,"You know--when you asked me to--marry you, faltered Tuppence, her"
"18775",1155,"eyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, and"
"18776",1155,"wouldnt take no for an answer. Ive thought it well over----"
"18777",1155,""
"18778",1155,"Yes? said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead."
"18779",1155,""
"18780",1155,"Tuppence relented suddenly."
"18781",1155,""
"18782",1155,"You great idiot! she said. What on earth induced you to do it? I"
"18783",1155,"could see at the time you didnt care a twopenny dip for me!"
"18784",1155,""
"18785",1155,"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of esteem and"
"18786",1155,"respect--and admiration for you----"

"18788",1155,"Hm! said Tuppence. Those are the kind of sentiments that very soon"

"18790",1155,"thing?"
"18791",1155,""
"18792",1155,"I dont know what you mean, said Julius stiffly, but a large and"
"18793",1155,"burning blush overspread his countenance."
"18794",1155,""
"18795",1155,"Shucks! retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening"
"18796",1155,"it to add with dignity: Morally, I shall always consider I have been"
"18797",1155,"jilted!"
"18798",1155,""
"18799",1155,"What was it? asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her."

"18806",1155,"Not until to-night, when youre going to burst upon every one like King"
"18807",1155,"Solomon in his glory! Come on! _Were going to shop!_"

"18809",1155,"To most people the 29th, the much-heralded Labour Day, had passed much"
"18810",1155,"as any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square."
"18811",1155,"Straggling processions, singing the _Red Flag_, wandered through the"
"18812",1155,"streets in a more or less aimless manner. Newspapers which had hinted at"
"18813",1155,"a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced"
"18814",1155,"to hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among"
"18815",1155,"them sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their"
"18816",1155,"counsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir"
"18817",1155,"James Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Mondays paper"
"18818",1155,"dealt appreciatively with the dead mans career. The exact manner of his"

"18821",1155,"Tommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a"
"18822",1155,"one-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces."
"18823",1155,"Kramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early"
"18824",1155,"on Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic,"
"18825",1155,"leaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which"
"18826",1155,"compromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their"
"18827",1155,"hands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of the"
"18828",1155,"dead man which had contained a full and damning rsum of the whole"
"18829",1155,"plot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour"
"18830",1155,"leaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cats"
"18831",1155,"paw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly"
"18832",1155,"accepted. It was to be Peace, not War!"

"18938",1155,"awful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of Annette, and"

"18947",1155,"That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me"

"18950",1155,"drawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector"
"18951",1155,"Brown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James"
"18952",1155,"who had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldnt make up"
"18953",1155,"my mind--and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note"
"18954",1155,"for Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine,"
"18955",1155,"and I dropped Sir Jamess letter with the offer of the job by the desk"
"18956",1155,"so that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to"
"18957",1155,"Mr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my confidence would"
"18958",1155,"be the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I"
"18959",1155,"believed the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the"
"18960",1155,"track of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept"
"18961",1155,"my mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from"
"18962",1155,"Tuppence--and I knew!"

"18975",1155,"came bursting up in his car, I felt it wasnt part of Mr. Browns"
"18976",1155,"plan--and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was"

"18985",1155,"he wouldnt worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I"
"18986",1155,"told Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told"
"18987",1155,"him the whole story. We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met"
"18988",1155,"Mr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid"

"19212",1155,""
"19213",1155,"In the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,"
"19214",1155,"very stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack of"
"19215",1155,"originality, was also returning to the _Ritz_ via Regents Park."
"19216",1155,""
"19217",1155,"A terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them. Without"
"19218",1155,"quite knowing what had happened, everything seemed changed. They were"
"19219",1155,"tongue-tied--paralysed. All the old _camaraderie_ was gone."
"19220",1155,""
"19221",1155,"Tuppence could think of nothing to say."
"19222",1155,""
"19223",1155,"Tommy was equally afflicted."
"19224",1155,""
"19225",1155,"They sat very straight and forbore to look at each other."
"19226",1155,""
"19227",1155,"At last Tuppence made a desperate effort."
"19228",1155,""
"19229",1155,"Rather fun, wasnt it?"
"19230",1155,""
"19231",1155,"Rather."
"19232",1155,""
"19233",1155,"Another silence."
"19234",1155,""
"19235",1155,"I like Julius, essayed Tuppence again."
"19236",1155,""
"19237",1155,"Tommy was suddenly galvanized into life."
"19238",1155,""
"19239",1155,"Youre not going to marry him, do you hear? he said dictatorially. I"
"19240",1155,"forbid it."
"19241",1155,""
"19242",1155,"Oh! said Tuppence meekly."
"19243",1155,""
"19244",1155,"Absolutely, you understand."
"19245",1155,""
"19246",1155,"He doesnt want to marry me--he really only asked me out of kindness."
"19247",1155,""
"19248",1155,"Thats not very likely, scoffed Tommy."
"19249",1155,""
"19250",1155,"Its quite true. Hes head over ears in love with Jane. I expect hes"
"19251",1155,"proposing to her now."
"19252",1155,""
"19253",1155,"Shell do for him very nicely, said Tommy condescendingly."
"19254",1155,""
"19255",1155,"Dont you think shes the most lovely creature youve ever seen?"
"19256",1155,""
"19257",1155,"Oh, I dare say."
"19258",1155,""
"19259",1155,"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth, said Tuppence demurely."
"19260",1155,""
"19261",1155,"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!"
"19262",1155,""
"19263",1155,"I like your uncle, Tommy, said Tuppence, hastily creating a diversion."
"19264",1155,"By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carters offer of"
"19265",1155,"a Government job, or accept Juliuss invitation and take a richly"
"19266",1155,"remunerated post in America on his ranch?"
"19267",1155,""
"19268",1155,"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though its awfully good of"
"19269",1155,"Hersheimmer. But I feel youd be more at home in London."
"19270",1155,""
"19271",1155,"I dont see where I come in."
"19272",1155,""
"19273",1155,"I do, said Tommy positively."
"19274",1155,""
"19275",1155,"Tuppence stole a glance at him sideways."
"19276",1155,""
"19277",1155,"Theres the money, too, she observed thoughtfully."
"19278",1155,""
"19279",1155,"What money?"
"19280",1155,""
"19281",1155,"Were going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so."
"19282",1155,""
"19283",1155,"Did you ask how much? inquired Tommy sarcastically."
"19284",1155,""
"19285",1155,"Yes, said Tuppence triumphantly. But I shant tell you."
"19286",1155,""
"19287",1155,"Tuppence, you are the limit!"
"19288",1155,""
"19289",1155,"It has been fun, hasnt it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots more"
"19290",1155,"adventures."
"19291",1155,""
"19292",1155,"Youre insatiable, Tuppence. Ive had quite enough adventures for the"
"19293",1155,"present."
"19294",1155,""
"19295",1155,"Well, shopping is almost as good, said Tuppence dreamily. Think of"
"19296",1155,"buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist silk curtains,"
"19297",1155,"and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of cushions."
"19298",1155,""
"19299",1155,"Hold hard, said Tommy. Whats all this for?"
"19300",1155,""
"19301",1155,"Possibly a house--but I think a flat."
"19302",1155,""
"19303",1155,"Whose flat?"
"19304",1155,""
"19305",1155,"You think I mind saying it, but I dont in the least! _Ours_, so"
"19306",1155,"there!"
"19307",1155,""
"19308",1155,"You darling! cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. I was"
"19309",1155,"determined to make you say it. I owe you something for the relentless"
"19310",1155,"way youve squashed me whenever Ive tried to be sentimental."
"19311",1155,""
"19312",1155,"Tuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course round"
"19313",1155,"the north side of Regents Park."
"19314",1155,""
"19315",1155,"You havent really proposed now, pointed out Tuppence. Not what our"
"19316",1155,"grandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening to a rotten one"
"19317",1155,"like Juliuss, Im inclined to let you off."
"19318",1155,""
"19319",1155,"You wont be able to get out of marrying me, so dont you think it."
"19320",1155,""
"19321",1155,"What fun it will be, responded Tuppence. Marriage is called all sorts"
"19322",1155,"of things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory, and a state of"
"19323",1155,"bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I think it is?"
"19324",1155,""
"19325",1155,"What?"
"19326",1155,""
"19327",1155,"A sport!"
"19328",1155,""
"19329",1155,"And a damned good sport too, said Tommy."
